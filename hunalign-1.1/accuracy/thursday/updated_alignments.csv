"That old gentleman with the wild, white beard and the wild, white hat that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others.","Ce vieux monsieur, avec sa vaste barbe sauvage et son vaste et sauvage chapeau, ce venerable charlatan, ce n'est pas un philosophe : c'est un theme de philosophie.",41,aligned
"That young man with the long, auburn hair and the impudent face that young man was not really a poet; but surely he was a poem.","Ce jeune homme, par exemple, avec ses longs cheveux chatains et sa mine impertinente, ne voyez pas en lui un poete : c'est un poeme.",42,aligned
"More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud.","Ce charme de l'irreel etait surtout sensible le soir, quand les toits bizarres se decoupaient en valeurs sombres sur le couchant et que tout le chimerique endroit se detachait, en quelque sorte, visiblement du monde ordinaire, comme une nuee flotte dans le ciel.",43,aligned
"Even if the people were not ""artists,"" the whole was nevertheless artistic.","Si ce n'etaient pas des artistes qui habitaient la, l'ensemble n'en avait pas moins un caractere artiste.",44,aligned
Nor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect.,"Et, s'il rencontrait l'un d'eux, son impression n'en etait pas modifiee.",45,aligned
The stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them.,"L'etranger, qui jetait pour la premiere fois un regard sur ces curieuses maisons rouges, devait faire sans doute quelque effort d'imagination pour se representer la structure singuliere de leurs habitants.",46,aligned
"But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable.","Endroit fort agreable, d'ailleurs, si ses pretentions au titre de centre intellectuel pouvaient passer pour exagerees.",47,aligned
"It was described with some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any definable way produced any art.","Dans le public, on traitait ce faubourg de colonie d'artistes. Non qu'aucun art y fut particulierement cultive, mais l'aspect, l'atmosphere en etait << artiste >>.",48,aligned
"It had been the outburst of a speculative builder, faintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical.","On devait cette creation a la fantaisie d'un speculateur audacieux, qui possedait quelque vague teinture d'art. Il qualifiait l'architecture de son faubourg tantot de << style Elizabeth >>, tantot de << style reine Anne >> ; sans doute, dans sa pensee, les deux souveraines n'en faisaient qu'une.",49,aligned
"It was built of a bright brick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground plan was wild.",toutes construites en briques claires. Le sol meme en etait etrangement tourmente.,50,aligned
"The place was not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream.","Cet endroit etait non seulement agreable, il etait parfait pour peu qu'on le considerat non comme truque mais plutot comme un reve.",51,aligned
"This again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often illuminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit.","Ce charme etait, veritablement, irresistible les soirs de fete locale, quand de grosses lanternes venitiennes, fruits monstrueux des arbres nains, illuminaient les jardinets.",52,aligned
"And this was strongest of all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the locality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero.","Et ce charme fut plus sensible, plus irresistible que jamais, un certain soir dont on se souvient encore dans le voisinage et dont le poete aux cheveux chatains fut le heros.",53,aligned
It was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero.,"Il avait ete, du reste, le heros de bien d'autres soirs avant celui-la.",54,aligned
"The whole was so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent secrecy.",Et tout cela etait si rapproche du sol qu'on ne pouvait s'expliquer le phenomene.,55,aligned
"Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green; but towards the west the whole grew past description, transparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen.","Au milieu du dome celeste, ces plumes etaient grises, avec de bizarres touches de violet, de mauve, de rose, de vert pale invraisemblablement. Mais il est impossible de rendre la transparence et le ton passionne de l'occident ; les dernieres plumes, d'un rouge feu, couvraient le soleil comme une chose trop belle pour que personne meritat de la voir.",56,aligned
"All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed the face.","Tout le ciel paraissait couvert d'un plumage palpable et vivant. Un ciel plein de plumes, de plumes qu'on croyait sentir vous effleurer le visage.",57,aligned
It looked like the end of the world.,Un coucher de soleil de fin du monde.,58,aligned
"This particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else, will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset.",La soiree dont il s'agit restera memorable tout au moins par son etonnant coucher de soleil.,59,aligned
This combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population.,"Ce contraste surexcitait jusqu'a la peur une galerie de femmes neurastheniques : elles goutaient ce blaspheme vivant, cette combinaison d'ange et de singe.",60,aligned
"From within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected suddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt.",Mais de ce cadre mystique jaillissait une face large et brutale ; le menton avancait avec une expression meprisante qui sentait le cockney.,61,aligned
"His dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman's, and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture.","Ses cheveux d'un rouge sombre, separes au milieu, etaient longs comme des cheveux de femme ; ils bouclaient en decrivant les molles courbes dont les peintres preraphaelites ne manquent pas d'agrementer les chevelures de leurs Vierges.",62,aligned
"He was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance, which he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it was worth.","L'originalite de son aspect physique le servait a souhait, et il savait en jouer, en connaissant la valeur.",63,aligned
He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure.,"Il debitait la vieille fable de l'anarchie de l'art et de l'art de l'anarchie avec une certaine fraicheur, un ragout d'insolence ou l'on pouvait trouver quelque bref agrement.",64,aligned
"And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the red-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening to, even if one only laughed at the end of it.","A vrai dire, M. Lucien Gregory meritait qu'on l'ecoutat, ne fut-ce que pour rire, ensuite, de ses discours.",65,aligned
"Yet these new women would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him, that of listening while he is talking.","Or, ces personnes << nouvelles >> etaient toujours disposees a vous accorder cet honneur que jamais aucune femme ordinaire n'accorde a aucun homme : elles vous ecoutaient tandis que vous parliez.",66,aligned
"Most of the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated, and professed some protest against male supremacy.","Elles appartenaient presque toutes -- je parle de celles qui habitaient le faubourg -- a la categorie des emancipees, et faisaient en consequence profession de protester contre la suprematie du male.",67,aligned
The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place.,"L'attitude des femmes, dans ces occasions, etait meme fort remarquable.",68,aligned
"On many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high, didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women.","Il ne se passait guere de jour qu'on ne put entendre, des le crepuscule tombe, la voix haute et professorale de ce jeune homme dicter, du fond de son petit jardin, des lois a l'humanite entiere, et plus particulierement aux femmes.",69,aligned

"Gregory resumed in high oratorical good humour. ~~~ ""An artist is identical with an anarchist,"" he cried. ~~~ ""You might transpose the words anywhere.","Gregory reprit, avec l'aisance et la bonne humeur d'un orateur de grand style : -- Artiste, anarchiste ; personnages identiques, termes interchangeables.",77,aligned
"An anarchist is an artist. ~~~ The man who throws a bomb is an artist, because he prefers a great moment to everything.","L'homme qui jette une bombe est un artiste, parce qu'il prefere a toutes choses la beaute d'un grand instant.",78,aligned

Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions; but I'm hanged if I can see why they are poetical.,"Dans certains cas desesperes, il se peut que la maladie et la revolte soient des signes de sante, mais que je sois pendu si j'y vois la moindre poesie !",115,aligned

"She was looking at him from under level brows; her face was grave and open, and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most frivolous woman, the maternal watch which is as old as the world.","Elle le regardait de dessous ses sourcils egaux ; son visage etait serieux et franc : on y lisait la preoccupation instinctive de la responsabilite, qui est au fond de la femme la plus frivole, cette sollicitude maternelle, aussi vieille que le monde.",143,aligned
"""Is he really an anarchist, then?"" ~~~ she asked.","-- Enfin, interrogea-t-elle encore, est-il vraiment un anarchiste ?",144,aligned
"""Only in that sense I speak of,"" replied Syme; ""or if you prefer it, in that nonsense.""","-- Au sens restreint que je viens de dire, oui, et ce sens est insense.",145,aligned

"""Good Lord, no!"" he said, ""that has to be done anonymously.""","-- Seigneur ! s'ecria-t-il, certes non ! Cela ne se fait que sous l'anonymat.",147,aligned
"Syme broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure.","Syme eclata d'un rire enorme qui paraissait trop fort pour sa frele stature, d'un rire excessif pour le dandy qu'il etait un peu.",148,aligned
"And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory's absurdity and of his safety.",Rosamonde rit aussi. ~~~ Elle pensait avec plaisir a la fois que Gregory etait absurde et qu'il ne se compromettrait pas.,149,aligned
"Syme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and continued to pour out his opinions.",Ils firent quelques pas ensemble et gagnerent un banc dans un coin du jardin. ~~~ Syme continuait a developper avec abondance ses opinions.,150,aligned
"For he was a sincere man, and in spite of his superficial airs and graces, at root a humble one.","C'etait un homme sincere et, malgre l'affectation de son attitude et ses graces artificielles, un homme plein d'humilite au fond.",151,aligned
And it is always the humble man who talks too much; the proud man watches himself too closely.,C'est toujours l'homme humble qui parle trop ; l'orgueilleux s'observe de plus pres.,152,aligned
He defended respectability with violence and exaggeration.,"Il defendait les convenances et la respectabilite avec violence, avec exageration.",153,aligned
He grew passionate in his praise of tidiness and propriety.,"Il louait la correction, la simplicite, avec emportement.",154,aligned
All the time there was a smell of lilac all round him.,Une odeur de lilas flottait autour de lui.,155,aligned
"Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel-organ begin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world.","A un certain moment, les sons lointains d'un orgue de Barbarie lui parvinrent et il lui sembla qu'une voix mysterieuse et menue s'elevait du fond de la terre ou d'au-dela pour accompagner ses heroiques discours.",156,aligned
"He stared and talked at the girl's red hair and amused face for what seemed to be a few minutes; and then, feeling that the groups in such a place should mix, rose to his feet.","Il n'y avait, semblait-il, que quelques minutes qu'il parlait ainsi, sans perdre du regard la fauve chevelure de la jeune fille, quand, songeant tout a coup qu'en un pareil endroit les couples ne devaient pas s'isoler, il se leva.",157,aligned
"To his astonishment, he discovered the whole garden empty.","A sa grande surprise, il vit que le jardin etait desert.",158,aligned
"Everyone had gone long ago, and he went himself with a rather hurried apology.","Tout le monde etait parti. ~~~ Il se retira a son tour, en presentant rapidement ses excuses.",159,aligned
"He left with a sense of champagne in his head, which he could not afterwards explain.","La tete lui pesait, comme s'il avait bu un peu trop de champagne, -- ce qu'il ne put, dans la suite, s'expliquer.",160,aligned
In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no part at all; he never saw her again until all his tale was over.,"Dans les incroyables evenements qui allaient se produire, la jeune fille n'avait aucun role ; Syme ne devait pas la revoir avant le denouement de l'aventure.",161,aligned
"And yet, in some indescribable way, she kept recurring like a motive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards, and the glory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark and ill-drawn tapestries of the night. ~~~ For what followed was so improbable, that it might well have been a dream.","Et pourtant, a travers ces folles aventures, sans qu'on put dire comment, elle ne cessait de revenir, comme un leit-motiv, la gloire de son etrange chevelure fauve transparaissait a travers les tendres tapisseries mal tissees de la nuit : car ce qui suivit fut si invraisemblable qu'aussi bien eut-ce pu etre un reve.",162,aligned
"Directly outside the door stood a street lamp, whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him.","Juste en face de la porte qui venait de se fermer derriere lui, brillait la lumiere d'un reverbere, jetant un eclat d'or sur les feuilles de l'arbre qui depassaient la grille.",163,aligned
Then he realised (in some odd way) that the silence was rather a living silence than a dead one.,"Puis, il se rendit compte obscurement que le silence etait vivant.",164,aligned
"When Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the moment empty.","Ayant gagne la rue qu'eclairaient les etoiles, Syme la trouva deserte.",165,aligned
"The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the face, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark.","Le grand chapeau et la longue redingote etaient noirs ; le visage, dans l'ombre, paraissait noir aussi.",166,aligned
"He made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more formally returned.","Il esquissa un salut equivoque, que Syme lui rendit plus correctement.",167,aligned
About a foot from the lamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp-post itself.,"A un pied, a peu pres, du reverbere se tenait un homme, presque aussi droit et immobile que le reverbere lui-meme.",168,aligned
"Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light, and also something aggressive in the attitude, proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory.","A quelques meches de cheveux rouges qui depassaient les bords du chapeau et a je ne sais quoi d'agressif dans l'attitude, Syme reconnut le poete Gregory.",169,aligned
He had something of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe.,"Il avait un peu l'air d'un bravo attendant, l'epee a la main, son ennemi.",170,aligned
"""I was waiting for you,"" said Gregory.","-- Je vous attendais, dit Gregory.",171,aligned

"""About what?"" asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder.","""Et de quoi ? demanda Syme avec une nuance d'etonnement.""",175,aligned
"""About _this_ and _this_,"" he cried; ""about order and anarchy.","-- De ceci, repondit-il, et de ceci : de l'ordre et de l'anarchie.",176,aligned
"There is your precious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and barren; and there is anarchy, rich, living, reproducing itself there is anarchy, splendid in green and gold.""","Voici cet ordre qui vous est si cher ; c'est cette mince lampe de fer, laide et sterile. ~~~ Et voici l'anarchie, riche, vivante, feconde, voila l'anarchie dans sa splendeur verte et doree.",177,aligned
"The silence fell again, and Syme, though he understood nothing, listened instinctively for something serious.","Le silence retomba. Syme, sans y rien comprendre, s'appretait a ecouter, s'attendant a quelque chose de serieux.",178,aligned
"""All the same,"" replied Syme patiently, ""just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp.

Nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical.,Il n'y avait pas trace d'hypocrisie dans sa haine de l'anarchie.,608,aligned
He had not attained it by any tame tradition.,Ce n'etait pas la tradition qui l'y avait amene.,609,aligned
"His respectability was spontaneous and sudden, a rebellion against rebellion.",Son amour des convenances avait ete spontane et soudain. Il tenait pour l'ordre etabli par rebellion contre la rebellion.,610,aligned
"He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions.","Il sortait d'une famille d'originaux, dont les membres les plus anciens avaient toujours eu sur toutes choses les notions les plus neuves.",611,aligned
He was one of those who are driven early in life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists.,Il etait un de ceux que la stupefiante folie de la plupart des revolutionnaires amene a un conservatisme excessif.,612,aligned
His father cultivated art and self-realisation; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene.,"Son pere etait artiste, et cultivait son moi. Sa mere etait ferue d'hygiene et de simplicite.",613,aligned
"One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else.","L'un de ses oncles avait l'habitude de ne jamais se promener que sans chapeau. Un autre avait essaye, d'ailleurs sans succes, de ne s'habiller que d'un chapeau.",614,aligned
"Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinth and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.","Il en resulta que, durant son age tendre, l'enfant ne connut pas d'autre boisson que ces deux extremes : l'absinthe et le cacao ; il en concut, pour l'une et pour l'autre, un degout salutaire.",615,aligned
"The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism, the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism.","Plus sa mere prechait une abstinence ultra-puritaine, plus son pere preconisait une licence ultra-paienne, et, tandis que l'une imposait chez elle le vegetarisme, l'autre n'etait pas loin de prendre la defense du cannibalisme.",616,aligned
"Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing left sanity.","Entoure qu'il etait depuis son enfance par toutes les formes possibles de la revolte, il etait fatal que Gabriel se revoltat aussi contre quelque chose ou en faveur de quelque chose. C'est ce qu'il fit en faveur du bon sens, ou du sens commun.",617,aligned
It happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage.,Il traversait je ne sais quelle rue de Londres au moment ou une bombe y eclata.,618,aligned
His hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident.,Un accident exaspera sa haine du moderne anarchisme.,619,aligned
But there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible.,Mais il avait dans ses veines trop de sang fanatique pour que sa conception du sens commun fut tout a fait sensee.,620,aligned
"He had been blind and deaf for a moment, and then seen, the smoke clearing, the broken windows and the bleeding faces.","Il fut d'abord aveugle, assourdi, puis, la fumee se dissipant, il vit des fenetres brisees et des figures ensanglantees.",621,aligned
"After that he went about as usual quiet, courteous, rather gentle; but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane.","Depuis lors, il continua de vivre, en apparence, comme par le passe, calme, poli, de manieres douces ; mais il y avait, dans son esprit, un endroit qui n'etait plus parfaitement normal et sain.",622,aligned
"He did not regard anarchists, as most of us do, as a handful of morbid men, combining ignorance with intellectualism.","Il ne considerait pas, ainsi que la plupart d'entre nous, les anarchistes comme une poignee de detraques combinant l'ignorance et l'intellectualisme.",623,aligned
"He regarded them as a huge and pitiless peril, like a Chinese invasion.","Il voyait dans leurs doctrines un immense danger social, quelque chose de comparable a une invasion chinoise.",624,aligned
It looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country.,(No direct equivalent in text),625,not aligned
"The sky, indeed, was so swarthy, and the light on the river relatively so lurid, that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored.","Le ciel etait si charge et le fleuve si brillant que le ciel palissait aupres du flot de feu liquide, s'ecoulant a travers les vastes cavernes d'une mysterieuse region souterraine.",626,aligned
"He poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste-paper baskets a torrent of tales, verses and violent articles, warning men of this deluge of barbaric denial.","Il deversait sans repit dans les journaux, et aussi dans les paniers des salles de redaction, un torrent de nouvelles, de vers et de violents articles, ou il denoncait ce deluge de barbarie et de negation.",627,aligned
"But he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy, and, what was worse, no nearer a living.","Mais, malgre tant d'efforts, il ne parvenait pas a atteindre son ennemie, ni meme, ce qui est plus grave, a se faire une situation sociale.",628,aligned
"As he paced the Thames embankment, bitterly biting a cheap cigar and brooding on the advance of Anarchy, there was no anarchist with a bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he.","Quand il se promenait sur les quais de la Tamise, mordant amerement un cigare a bas prix et meditant sur les progres de l'Anarchie, il n'y avait pas d'anarchiste, bombe en poche, plus sauvage d'aspect que ce solitaire ami de l'ordre.",629,aligned
"Indeed, he always felt that Government stood alone and desperate, with its back to the wall.","Il se persuadait que le gouvernement, la societe, etaient isoles, dans une situation desesperee, au pied du mur.",630,aligned
He was too quixotic to have cared for it otherwise.,Il ne fallait rien moins que cette situation desesperee pour apitoyer ce Don Quichotte.,631,aligned
He walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset.,"Ce soir-la, le soleil se couchait dans le sang.",632,aligned
"The red river reflected the red sky, and they both reflected his anger.","L'eau rouge refletait le ciel rouge, et, dans le ciel et dans l'eau, Syme reconnaissait la couleur de sa colere.",633,aligned
Syme was shabby in those days.,"Syme, a cette epoque, manquait d'argent.",634,aligned
"He wore an old-fashioned black chimney-pot hat; he was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak, black and ragged; and the combination gave him the look of the early villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton.","Il portait un chapeau haut de forme demode, un manteau noir et dechire encore plus demode, et cette tenue lui donnait l'air des traitres de Dickens et de Bulwer Lytton.",635,aligned
"Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards, cut and pointed, on the lawns of Saffron Park.","Sa barbe et ses cheveux blonds se herissaient. On n'eut guere pressenti en ce personnage leonin, le parfait gentleman qui, longtemps apres, devait penetrer dans les jardinets de Saffron Park ;",636,aligned
"A long, lean, black cigar, bought in Soho for twopence, stood out from between his tightened teeth, and altogether he looked a very satisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a holy war.","entre ses dents serrees il tenait un long cigare noir qu'il avait achete quatre sous dans Soho, il ressemblait assez a l'un de ces anarchistes contre lesquels il menait la guerre sainte.",637,aligned
"Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke to him, and said ""Good evening.""","C'est peut-etre pourquoi un policeman, en faction sur les quais, s'approcha de lui et lui dit : -- Bonsoir.",638,aligned
"""You fellows would call the end of the world a good evening.""","Pour vous autres, la fin du monde aussi serait un beau soir...",639,aligned
"""A good evening is it?"" he said sharply.","""En verite, dit-il d'un ton cassant, le soir est-il si bon ou si beau ?",640,aligned

"Syme drew closer and closer, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.","Et, tout en faisant ces remarques, Syme se rapprochait toujours ; et l'homme restait toujours immobile.",796,aligned

"They made him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some Egyptian palace; and, indeed, the thing suited his mood, for he was, in his own mind, mounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings.","Syme crut aborder aux marches colossales de quelque palais d'Egypte. ~~~ L'idee lui plut. Ne pensait-il pas, en effet, monter a l'assaut des trones massifs ou siegeaient d'horribles rois paiens !",798,aligned
"As Syme drew nearer to him step by step, he did not even move a hair; and Syme could come close enough to notice even in the dim, pale morning light that his face was long, pale and intellectual, and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin, all else being clean-shaven.","De marche en marche, la distance diminuait entre eux ; l'homme ne bougeait pas.

The two men in the tug put her off again and turned up stream.,Les deux hommes firent reculer le bateau et commencerent a remonter le fleuve.,800,aligned

The great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic as Syme looked up at them. They were big and black against the huge white dawn.,"Les grandes pierres du quai apparurent, gigantesques et sombres, opposant leur masse noire a la blanche aurore.",803,aligned
"It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead, showing bars of silver; and these had brightened like white fire when the tug, changing its onward course, turned inward to a large landing stage rather beyond Charing Cross.","De grandes barres de plomb apparurent dans le ciel, puis s'effacerent sous des barres d'argent qui prirent bientot l'eclat du metal chauffe a blanc.

At first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a pyramid; but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river.,"Tout d'abord, Syme crut l'escalier de pierre desert comme une pyramide. Mais, avant d'avoir atteint le dernier degre, il se rendit compte qu'il y avait un homme accoude au parapet, et que cet homme regardait le fleuve.",807,aligned
They had never spoken a word.,"Pendant toute la duree du voyage, ils n'avaient pas prononce une parole.",808,aligned
For the man remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close.,"Un individu frole, presque, par un etranger ne reste pas a ce point immobile et calme sans raison.",809,aligned
"There was the silent river and the silent man, a man of even classic face.","Ce fleuve silencieux, cet homme silencieux, au visage classique...",810,aligned
"But in all Syme's circumstances, with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones, there was something unnerving in it.","Mais, dans les circonstances ou se trouvait Syme, sous l'influence de cette aurore menacante, avec la mission meurtriere dont il etait charge, dans la solitude de ces grandes pierres ruisselantes, il recut de cet accueil une impression etrange, qui le glaca, qui le paralysa.",811,aligned
"Many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile, and in many it is even attractive.","Bien des gens ont ce tic nerveux, ce rictus grimacant, et il en est meme chez qui c'est une grace.",812,aligned
"Then he took out of his pocket the note from Buttons proving his election, and put it before that sad and beautiful face.","et tout a coup, tirant de sa poche le document qui lui conferait le titre de Jeudi, il le mit sous les yeux tristes et doux de l'inconnu.",813,aligned
"Then the man smiled, and his smile was a shock, for it was all on one side, going up in the right cheek and down in the left.","Alors, celui-ci sourit, d'un sourire inquietant, d'un sourire << d'un seul cote >>, qui haussait la joue droite et abaissait la gauche.",814,aligned
"Syme looked again and again at the pale, dignified and delicate face, and the face still looked blankly across the river.","Syme considerait toujours cette figure pale, delicate et digne, dont le regard eteint ne se detournait pas de la riviere,",815,aligned
"He was as motionless as a wax-work, and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way.","Il etait aussi inerte et a peu pres aussi enervant, par la meme, qu'une poupee de cire.",816,aligned
And there was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong.,"Et, comme touche finale au cauchemar, ce sourire grimacant.",817,aligned
"There was nothing, rationally speaking, to scare anyone about this.","Raisonnablement, toutefois, il n'y avait la rien d'effroyable.",818,aligned
"The spasm of smile was instantaneous, and the man's face dropped at once into its harmonious melancholy.","Mais cette grimace s'effaca instantanement, et la physionomie de l'anarchiste reprit son expression d'harmonieuse melancolie.",819,aligned

But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President, for his notions grow like a tropical forest.","-- Sans nul doute, le president de la section vous a dit tout ce qu'il pouvait vous dire. Mais la seule chose qu'on ne puisse jamais dire, c'est la derniere idee de Dimanche car ses idees se multiplient comme les vegetations d'une foret tropicale.",832,aligned
"It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences, and that his only life was hate.","On eut jure qu'il s'acquittait de ces gestes et propos de bonne grace comme d'insignifiantes obligations, et qu'il ne vivait que de haine.",833,aligned
"He spoke with casual civility, but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism of his face.","Il parlait avec une civilite negligente, mais d'une voix extremement monotone qui faisait un vif contraste avec l'ardeur fanatique de sa physionomie.",834,aligned
"""Nor have I,"" answered the man in an ordinary tone. ""I shall try to get to bed after breakfast.""","-- Moi non plus, repondit l'autre d'une voix egale. Je tacherai de dormir apres dejeuner.",835,aligned
"""No,"" said Syme.",-- Non.,836,aligned
Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant.,"Puis, Dimanche nous convoqua dans un cabinet de restaurant.",837,aligned
"""It's quite simple what they say,"" answered his guide.","-- Ils disent, reprit son guide, que nous sommes de gais compagnons, des gentlemen qui se pretendent anarchistes.",838,aligned
"""Clever!",-- Ingenieuse !,839,aligned
"God blast your impudence! ~~~ Clever!""",Que Dieu punisse votre impudence !,840,aligned
"cried out the other in a sudden, shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile.",s'ecria l'autre d'une voix aigue qui etonnait et jurait avec son personnage tout autant qu'avec son rictus.,841,aligned
"""When you've seen Sunday for a split second you'll leave off calling him clever.""","Ingenieuse ! ~~~ Quand vous aurez vu Dimanche le quart d'une seconde, vous perdrez l'envie de traiter ses idees d'ingenieuses !",842,aligned
"With this they emerged out of a narrow street, and saw the early sunlight filling Leicester Square.","Sur ces mots, ils atteignirent le terme d'une rue etroite, et Leicester Square leur apparut, baigne dans la lumiere du matin.",843,aligned
"It will never be known, I suppose, why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental.","On ne saura jamais, je pense, pourquoi ce square a un aspect si etranger et, en quelque maniere, continental.",844,aligned
It will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who gave it the foreign look.,On ne saura jamais si c'est son aspect etranger qui attira les etrangers ou si ce sont les etrangers qui lui donnerent son aspect etranger.,845,aligned
But on this particular morning the effect seemed singularly bright and clear.,"Justement, ce matin-la, ce caractere de Leicester Square etait particulierement clair et evident.",846,aligned
"Between the open square and the sunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the Alhambra, it looked the replica of some French or even Spanish public place.","Le square ouvert et les feuilles ensoleillees des arbres, la statue et la silhouette sarrasine de l'Alhambra, evoquaient on ne savait quelle place publique de France ou d'Espagne.",847,aligned
"And this effect increased in Syme the sensation, which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure, the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world.","Syme eut de plus en plus nettement une sensation qui devait se reproduire bien des fois au cours de son aventure, la sensation aigue qu'il s'etait egare dans une planete nouvelle.",848,aligned
"As a fact, he had bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a boy.","En fait, il n'avait cesse d'acheter de mauvais cigares aux environs de Leicester Square, depuis sa jeunesse.",849,aligned
"But as he turned that corner, and saw the trees and the Moorish cupolas, he could have sworn that he was turning into an unknown Place de something or other in some foreign town.","Mais, ce jour-la, en decouvrant au tournant du coin les coupoles mauresques et les arbres, il eut jure qu'il debouchait sur la << Place de Chose ou Machin >> de quelque ville etrangere.",850,aligned
"In the wall there was one large French window, probably the window of a large coffee-room; and outside this window, almost literally overhanging the square, was a formidably buttressed balcony, big enough to contain a dining-table.","Au-dessus d'une grande porte-fenetre, sans doute la porte d'un cafe, un balcon enorme faisait saillie, dominant le square, un balcon assez spacieux pour qu'une table y fut mise.",851,aligned
"At one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous but quiet hotel, the bulk of which belonged to a street behind.","En angle, au coin du square, se profilait un hotel, dont la facade principale donnait sur une rue laterale.",852,aligned
"In fact, it did contain a dining-table, or more strictly a breakfast-table; and round the breakfast-table, glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street, were a group of noisy and talkative men, all dressed in the insolence of fashion, with white waistcoats and expensive button-holes.","Sur ce balcon, il y avait, en effet, une table, une table a dejeuner, et, autour de cette table, visible de la rue et en plein soleil, un groupe d'hommes bruyants et bavards, tous habilles avec l'insolence de la mode, le gilet blanc et la boutonniere fleurie.",853,aligned
Some of their jokes could almost be heard across the square.,"Quand ils plaisantaient, on les entendait parfois de l'autre bout du square.",854,aligned
"Then the grave Secretary gave his unnatural smile, and Syme knew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret conclave of the European Dynamiters.","Le grave compagnon de Syme fit sa grimace si peu naturelle, et Syme comprit que ces joyeux convives etaient les membres du conclave secret des dynamiteurs europeens.",855,aligned
"At the nearest end of the balcony, blocking up a great part of the perspective, was the back of a great mountain of a man.","A l'une des extremites du balcon, interceptant la perspective, c'etait le dos d'une gigantesque montagne humaine.",856,aligned
He had not seen it literally because it was too large to see.,"Et cela lui avait echappe, parce que c'etait trop grand pour etre vu tout d'abord.",857,aligned
"Then, as Syme continued to stare at them, he saw something that he had not seen before.","Puis, comme il ne pouvait detourner son regard de ce groupe, il y remarqua quelque chose qui tout d'abord lui avait echappe.",858,aligned
"When Syme had seen him, his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone.","En l'apercevant, Syme pensa tout de suite que le balcon de pierre allait ceder sous le poids de cette masse de chair.",859,aligned
Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe.,Syme n'avait pas un instant songe a demander si ce monstre qui remplissait le balcon etait bien le grand President dont les anarchistes ne pouvaient prononcer le nom sans trembler.,860,aligned
"This man was planned enormously in his original proportions, like a statue carved deliberately as colossal.","la cause reelle de l'impression d'excessif qu'il produisait etait dans l'ordonnance des plans de sa personne, dans les proportions originales selon lesquelles cette statue vivante avait ete executee.",861,aligned
"He knew it was so, with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty.","Il le savait, il l'avait su immediatement, sans qu'il lui eut ete possible de preciser les motifs de sa certitude.",862,aligned
His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat.,"Et ce n'etait pas seulement parce qu'il etait extraordinairement haut de stature, et incroyablement gros, que cet homme paraissait si ample :",863,aligned
"And the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm, much pleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs.","Et le garcon, sa serviette sous le bras, s'eloigna rapidement, fort amuse lui-meme de l'exceptionnelle frivolite de ces messieurs.",864,aligned
"They do say they will throw bombs at ze king.""",ils pretendent qu'ils veulent jeter des bombes sur le roi !,865,aligned
"""They do talk and they do laugh at what they talk.",ils causent joyeusement ;,866,aligned
The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears.,les oreilles paraissaient plus grandes que des oreilles humaines.,867,aligned
"As Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel, a waiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head.","Comme Syme et son guide approchaient de l'hotel, un garcon vint a eux souriant de toutes ses dents.",868,aligned
The two men mounted the stairs in silence.,Les deux hommes gravirent l'escalier en silence.,869,aligned
"""The gentlemen are up there, sare,"" he said.","-- Ces messieurs sont la-haut, dit-il ;",870,aligned
"His head, crowned with white hair, as seen from behind looked bigger than a head ought to be.","Vue de derriere comme la voyait Syme, la tete, couronnee de cheveux blancs, paraissait plus haute et plus large que nature,",871,aligned
"He was enlarged terribly to scale; and this sense of size was so staggering, that when Syme saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish.","Tout etait en proportion. Aupres de ce colosse, tous les autres hommes se rapetissaient, devenaient des nains.",872,aligned
"They were still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock-coats, but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea.","A les voir, assis tous les cinq autour de la table, on eut dit que le grand homme offrait le the a des enfants.",873,aligned
"Syme, indeed, was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health.","Syme etait un de ces hommes qui sont sujets aux influences psychologiques les plus obscures, a un degre qui ne va pas sans quelque danger pour la sante de l'esprit.",874,aligned
"Utterly devoid of fear in physical dangers, he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell of spiritual evil.","Inaccessible a la peur physique, il etait beaucoup trop sensible a l'odeur du mal moral.",875,aligned
"Twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out at him almost pruriently, and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to the head-quarters of hell. ~~~ And this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President.","Plusieurs fois deja pendant cette nuit, des choses insignifiantes avaient pris a ses yeux une importance capitale, lui donnant la sensation qu'il etait en route vers le quartier general de l'enfer ; et cette sensation devenait irresistible, maintenant qu'il allait aborder le grand President.",876,aligned
The form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy.,Elle prit la forme d'une suggestion puerile et pourtant detestable.,877,aligned
"As he walked across the inner room towards the balcony, the large face of Sunday grew larger and larger; and Syme was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible, and that he would scream aloud.","Comme il s'avancait vers le balcon en traversant la piece qui le precedait, il lui sembla que la large figure de Dimanche s'elargissait encore, s'amplifiait toujours, et Syme fut pris de terreur a la pensee que cette figure serait bientot trop vaste pour etre possible, et qu'il ne pourrait s'empecher de jeter un cri.",878,aligned
"He remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum, because it was a face, and so large.","Il se rappelait qu'enfant il ne pouvait regarder le masque de Memnon au Musee britannique, parce que c'etait une figure, et si grande.",879,aligned
"By an effort, braver than that of leaping over a cliff, he went to an empty seat at the breakfast-table and sat down.","Par un effort plus heroique que celui qu'il faudrait pour se precipiter du haut d'une falaise, il se dirigea vers un siege vacant aupres de la table et s'assit.",880,aligned
"He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid, shining coffee-pot;","Il retrouva un peu de serenite en constatant que ses voisins etaient convenablement et normalement vetus, que la cafetiere etait brillante et solide.",881,aligned
which gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast.,si bien qu'on se fut cru a un festin de noce.,882,aligned
"nothing about them caught the eye at first, except that by the President's caprice they had been dressed up with a festive respectability,","Rien de frappant, a premiere vue, sinon que, pour obeir au caprice du maitre, tous les membres du Conseil etaient mis comme pour un gala,",883,aligned
In the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace;,"Comparee au President, toute la compagnie avait l'air passablement vulgaire.",884,aligned
"His face was very large, but it was still possible to humanity.","oui, son visage etait fort grand, mais il ne depassait tout de meme pas les proportions permises a l'humanite.",885,aligned
then he looked again at Sunday.,"Puis, il jeta de nouveau un regard sur Dimanche :",886,aligned
The men greeted him with good-humoured raillery as if they had always known him.,"Les autres le saluerent avec bonne humeur, avec familiarite, comme s'ils l'avaient connu de longue date.",887,aligned
One man indeed stood out at even a superficial glance.,"L'un de ces individus se distinguait, pourtant, a l'examen le plus superficiel.",888,aligned
He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter.,On pouvait reconnaitre en lui le dynamiteur vulgaire et pour ainsi dire vulgaris.,889,aligned
"He wore, indeed, the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of the occasion; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite unmanageable and quite unmistakable, a bewildering bush of brown hair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a Skye terrier.","Il portait bien, comme les autres, un grand col blanc et une cravate de satin : l'uniforme. ~~~ Mais, de ce col et de cette cravate emergeait une tete indisciplinable. ~~~ Pas moyen de s'y tromper.",890,aligned
"But the eyes did look out of the tangle, and they were the sad eyes of some Russian serf.","C'etait une broussaille etonnante de barbe et de cheveux bruns ou luisaient les yeux d'un terrier, ou plutot peut-etre les yeux tristes d'un moujik russe.",891,aligned
"And, indeed, when Syme came in the President, with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy, was actually chaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces.","Justement, comme Syme entrait, le President, avec ce mepris audacieux de la suspicion publique dont il avait fait un principe, etait en train de railler Gogol, lui reprochant d'etre refractaire aux manieres et graces mondaines.",892,aligned
"Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock-coat, no one need know that he is an anarchist.","Qu'un gentleman coiffe du haut-de-forme, vetu de la redingote classique, se promene dignement dans Londres, personne ne soupconnera en lui un anarchiste.",893,aligned
"The effect of this figure was not terrible like that of the President, but it had every diablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque.","Cette figure n'etait pas terrifiante, comme celle du President ; mais elle avait toute cette diablerie qui est un effet de l'extreme grotesque.",894,aligned
"If out of that stiff tie and collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog, it could not have been a more idiotic contrast.","Si de ce col avait surgi une tete de chat ou de chien, le contraste n'eut pas ete plus deconcertant.",895,aligned
"The man's name, it seemed, was Gogol; he was a Pole, and in this circle of days he was called Tuesday.","Cet homme, parait-il, se nommait Gogol. Il etait polonais et, dans ce cycle des jours de la semaine, portait le nom de Mardi.",896,aligned
His soul and speech were incurably tragic; he could not force himself to play the prosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday.,"Sa physionomie et son langage etaient incurablement tragiques, et il n'etait point en etat de jouer le role frivole et joyeux que lui imposait Dimanche.",897,aligned
"""Our friend Tuesday,"" said the President in a deep voice at once of quietude and volume, ""our friend Tuesday doesn't seem to grasp the idea.","-- Notre ami Mardi, disait le President de sa voix profonde et calme, ne saisit pas bien mon idee.",898,aligned
"He dresses up like a gentleman, but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one.","Il s'habille comme un gentleman, mais on voit qu'il a l'ame trop grande pour se tenir comme un gentleman.",899,aligned
He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator.,Il ne peut renoncer aux attitudes des conspirateurs de melodrame.,900,aligned
"But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock-coat, and then goes about on his hands and knees well, he may attract attention.","Mais si, tout bien mis qu'il soit, il se met a marcher a quatre pattes, alors, certes, il attirera l'attention.",901,aligned
That's what Brother Gogol does.,C'est ce que fait le frere Gogol.,902,aligned
"He goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy, that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright.""",Il a mis une si profonde diplomatie a marcher a quatre pattes qu'il eprouve maintenant une reelle difficulte a se tenir sur ses pieds.,903,aligned
"""I am not good at concealment,"" said Gogol sulkily, with a thick foreign accent; ""I am not ashamed of the cause.""","'-- Che ne suis bas habile a me teguiser, fit Gogol d'un air farouche, avec un fort accent etranger. ~~~ Che n'ai bas honte de la gause.'",904,aligned
"""Yes you are, my boy, and so is the cause of you,"" said the President good-naturedly.","'-- Mais si ! ~~~ repliqua le President avec gaite, et la cause a honte de vous.'",905,aligned
"""You hide as much as anybody; but you can't do it, you see, you're such an ass! You try to combine two inconsistent methods.""","'Vous vous efforcez autant qu'un autre de vous cacher, mais vous n'y reussissez pas, parce que vous etes un ane. Vous pretendez concilier deux methodes inconciliables.'",906,aligned
"""When a householder finds a man under his bed, he will probably pause to note the circumstance.""","'Quand un proprietaire trouve un homme sous son lit, naturellement il prend note de cette circonstance.'",907,aligned
"""But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat, you will agree with me, my dear Tuesday, that he is not likely even to forget it.""","'Mais, si c'est un homme coiffe du haut-de-forme qu'il trouve sous son lit, il est peu probable, vous en conviendrez avec moi, mon cher Mardi, qu'il l'oublie facilement.'",908,aligned
"""Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin's bed...""","'Or, quand on vous trouva sous le lit de l'amiral Biffin...'",909,aligned
"The only metaphor he could think of was this, that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look, with the additional twist given in a false and curved mirror.","'Syme se formula a lui-meme sa propre pensee en se disant que ces gens-la lui apparaissaient comme auraient fait des gens a la mode et bien eleves avec la legere touche qu'y aurait ajoutee un miroir fausse, concave ou convexe.'",910,aligned
"""Right, my boy, right,"" said the President with a ponderous heartiness, ""you aren't good at anything.""","'-- Parfaitement, mon ami, parfaitement, mon ami, interrompit le President avec une lourde bonhomie : vous n'etes habile a rien.'",911,aligned
"""I am not good at deception,"" said Tuesday gloomily, flushing.",'-- Je ne suis pas habile a tromper le monde... repondit Gogol rougissant.',912,aligned
"But now that Syme had more space and light to observe him, there were other touches.","'Mais, maintenant que Syme pouvait le considerer a loisir et au grand jour, il distinguait en lui d'autres singularites.'",913,aligned
"Syme's original cicerone bore the title of Monday; he was the Secretary of the Council, and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything, except the President's horrible, happy laughter.","'Le cicerone de Syme etait Lundi, secretaire du Conseil. ~~~ Apres le rire abominablement rejoui du President, rien de plus affreux que le rictus du secretaire.'",914,aligned
Only the individual examples will express this half-concealed eccentricity.,'Des precisions individuelles pourront seules rendre compte de cette secrete anomalie.',915,aligned
"Each man had something about him, perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth glance, which was not normal, and which seemed hardly human.","'Ils avaient tous quelque chose d'exceptionnel, qui se derobait a la premiere analyse, et ce quelque chose d'exceptionnel etait quelque chose d'a peine humain.'",916,aligned
"His fine face was so emaciated, that Syme thought it must be wasted with some disease; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this.","'Ce visage noble, mais invraisemblablement emacie, denoncait-il les ravages de la maladie ? ~~~ L'intensite meme de la detresse qu'on lisait dans ses yeux protestait contre cette hypothese.'",917,aligned
"But as he looked at the others, he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river, a demoniac detail somewhere.","'Mais, en les etudiant avec plus d'attention, il observait en chacun d'eux, comme chez l'homme qui l'avait attendu sur le quai, un caractere demoniaque.'",918,aligned
"He had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume, with the evident exception of the hairy Gogol.","'Les commensaux de Dimanche, Gogol excepte, lui avaient d'abord paru des gens assez normaux et meme vulgaires, somme toute.'",919,aligned
"As he did so, he gradually felt all his sense of something spiritually queer return.",'Et de nouveau il se sentait opprime par l'horreur que lui causaient toujours les monstruosites psychiques.',920,aligned
"While this stream of conversation continued, Syme was looking more steadily at the men around him.","'Tandis que la conversation se poursuivait, Syme examinait les hommes qui l'entouraient.'",921,aligned
"That lop-sided laugh, which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide, was typical of all these types.",'Au rictus grimacant qui defigurait soudain les traits de son guide correspondait chez tous quelque deformation.',922,aligned
It was no physical ill that troubled him.,Cet homme ne souffrait pas d'un mal physique.,923,aligned
It reminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in the darker poems of Byron and Poe.,"Cela faisait songer aux odeurs enivrantes, aux lampes mourantes des plus mysterieux poemes de Byron ou de Poe.",924,aligned
"But Syme, sensitive to such things, felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him, a rich atmosphere that suffocated.","Syme ne tarda pas a s'apercevoir qu'on respirait autour de ce personnage une atmosphere terriblement capiteuse, capiteuse a en etouffer.",925,aligned
He had a black French beard cut square and a black English frock-coat cut even squarer.,"De tous, c'etait le seul qui portat ses habits elegants comme s'ils eussent ete vraiment les siens. Il arborait une barbe noire, taillee en carre, a la francaise ; mais sa redingote affectait la plus pure coupe britannique.",926,aligned
"Next was Wednesday, a certain Marquis de St. Eustache, a sufficiently characteristic figure.","Mais n'etait-ce pas un fou aussi que Mercredi, -- un certain marquis de Saint-Eustache, figure aussi peu banale que les deux autres ?",927,aligned
"Next to him sat Tuesday, the tousle-headed Gogol, a man more obviously mad.",La folie de Mardi se trahissait plus vite que celle de son voisin Lundi.,928,aligned
"His eyes were alive with intellectual torture, as if pure thought was pain.",Sa souffrance etait purement intellectuelle : c'etait sa pensee qui faisait sa torture.,929,aligned
"The first few glances found nothing unusual about him, except that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if they were really his own.","Au premier abord, on ne trouvait rien d'inusite chez lui.",930,aligned
He was typical of each of the tribe; each man was subtly and differently wrong.,Et ce trait apparentait entre eux tous les membres du Conseil.,931,aligned
"With this went a sense of his being clad, not in lighter colours, but in softer materials; his black seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him, as if it were compounded of profound colour.","Tout, chez lui, prenait un accent special ; le drap noir de son habit paraissait plus riche, plus chaud, teint d'une couleur plus intense que celle des ombres noires qui l'entouraient.",932,aligned
His black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple.,"Le secret de ce noir, c'est qu'il etait une pourpre trop dense.",933,aligned
His black beard looked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue.,"Et le secret aussi de sa barbe si noire, c'est qu'elle etait d'un bleu trop fonce.",934,aligned
he might be a Jew;,Peut-etre un juif ;,935,aligned
he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart of the East.,"mais, vraisemblablement ses racines plongeaient plus profondement encore au sombre coeur de l'Orient.",936,aligned
Whatever he was he was not a Frenchman;,"D'ou qu'il vint, il n'etait certainement pas francais.",937,aligned
And in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful.,"Dans l'epaisseur tenebreuse de cette barbe, la bouche, d'un rouge ardent, etincelait, sensuelle et meprisante.",938,aligned
"In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants hunting, you may see just those almond eyes, those blue-black beards, those cruel, crimson lips.","Dans les tableaux joyeusement barioles et sur les briques de la sombre cour de Perse, qui representent des tyrans en chasse, on voit de ces yeux en amande, de ces barbes noires aux reflets bleus, de ces levres ecarlates et feroces.",939,aligned
Again and again Syme strove to pull together his common sense in their presence.,"A plusieurs reprises, Syme fit un grand effort pour reconquerir son sang-froid en leur presence.",940,aligned
Such were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world.,Tels etaient les six hommes qui avaient jure la destruction du monde.,941,aligned
CHAPTER VI. THE EXPOSURE,* * * CHAPITRE VI DEMASQUE !,942,aligned
Syme even had the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were too frightful to see.,Il pensa meme que le docteur ne se cachait ainsi les yeux que parce qu'ils etaient trop horribles a voir.,943,aligned
"Partly from this, and partly because he had a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme that he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men.","Cette singularite, jointe a cette virilite vulgaire dont tous les autres, sauf Gogol, etaient prives, persuada Syme que le docteur aux yeux noirs devait etre le pire d'entre ces mauvais.",944,aligned
You could not tell what his smile or his gravity meant.,Que signifiait son eternel sourire ? Que voulait dire sa gravite ?,945,aligned
They took away the key of the face.,Elles cachaient pour ainsi dire ce qui en eut ete la cle.,946,aligned
But on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma.,"Elles ne convenaient pas a ce jeune homme rable, dont elles rendaient la physionomie bizarrement enigmatique.",947,aligned
"Had the dying Professor worn them, or even the pale Secretary, they would have been appropriate.","Sur le nez du vieux professeur ou du pale secretaire, elles ne l'eussent point surpris.",948,aligned
Syme's eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin.,"Le regard de Syme ne pouvait se detacher de ces lunettes noires, de ce sourire fige.",949,aligned
"Then came Syme, and next a very old man, Professor de Worms, who still kept the chair of Friday, though every day it was expected that his death would leave it empty.","Puis venait Syme, et puis un tres vieux monsieur, l'illustre professeur de Worms, occupait le siege de Vendredi. Du moins, il l'occupait encore, mais on pouvait chaque jour s'attendre a ce qu'il le laissat vacant.",950,aligned
"There was nothing whatever odd about him, except that he wore a pair of dark, almost opaque spectacles.","Seul signe particulier : il avait sur le nez une paire de lunettes aux verres noirs, presque opaques.",951,aligned
"In no other case, not even that of Gogol, did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more painful contrast.","Nul autre, pas meme Gogol, ne faisait avec son habit de fiance un contraste plus penible.",952,aligned
"It may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before, but those black discs were dreadful to Syme; they reminded him of half-remembered ugly tales, of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead.","Pourquoi ces disques sombres epouvanterent-ils Syme ? Peut-etre le crescendo d'imaginations delirantes qui l'agitait le predisposait-il a tout prendre au tragique. Il se rememora aussitot une affreuse histoire, a demi oubliee, ou il etait question de sous qu'on incrustait dans les yeux des morts.",953,aligned
"Save for his intellect, he was in the last dissolution of senile decay.","Encore que son cerveau gardat toute son activite, le professeur penchait au dernier periode de la decadence senile.",954,aligned
For the red flower in his button-hole showed up against a face that was literally discoloured like lead; the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes upon a corpse.,"La fleur rouge de sa boutonniere accusait, exagerait encore la lividite d'un visage litteralement decolore, plombe. ~~~ On eut dit un cadavre que quelques dandies ivres auraient affuble de leurs habits mondains.",955,aligned
"When he rose or sat down, which was with long labour and peril, something worse was expressed than mere weakness, something indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene.","Chaque fois qu'il devait se lever ou s'asseoir, ce qui n'allait pas sans peine, ses mouvements trahissaient quelque chose de pire qu'une simple faiblesse, quelque chose d'indefinissablement lie a l'horreur de toute la scene.",956,aligned
"It did not express decrepitude merely, but corruption.","Ce n'etait pas seulement de la decrepitude, c'etait deja de la pourriture !",957,aligned
"His face was as grey as his long grey beard, his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair.","Son visage etait aussi gris que sa longue barbe grise. Une ride profonde, expression d'un doux desespoir, creusait son front.",958,aligned
He could not help thinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off.,Il ne put s'empecher de penser qu'a chaque mouvement le professeur pouvait tres bien laisser choir un de ses bras ou une de ses jambes.,959,aligned
Another hateful fancy crossed Syme's quivering mind.,Une idee detestable traversa l'esprit fremissant de Syme.,960,aligned
He had that combination of _savoir-faire_ with a sort of well-groomed coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors.,On observait chez lui ce melange de desinvolture et de familiarite polie qui caracterise souvent les jeunes medecins.,961,aligned
"He carried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease, and he mostly wore a set smile.","Il portait ses beaux habits hardiment plutot qu'avec aisance, et un sourire vague restait fige sur ses levres.",962,aligned
"Right at the end sat the man called Saturday, the simplest and the most baffling of all.",Samedi tenait le bout de la table. ~~~ Le plus simple de tous ; non pas le moins etonnant.,963,aligned
"He was a short, square man with a dark, square face clean-shaven, a medical practitioner going by the name of Bull.","Ce petit homme trapu, au visage carre et rase de pres, portait le nom de Bull : le docteur Bull.",964,aligned
"Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective, that he was only looking at ordinary men, one of whom was old, another nervous, another short-sighted.","Par instants, il se rendait compte qu'il n'y avait la que des gens fort ordinaires, dont l'un etait vieux, l'autre neurasthenique, l'autre myope...",965,aligned
The sense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again.,Mais toujours il retombait sous l'empire d'un symbolisme fantastique.,966,aligned
"Each figure seemed to be, somehow, on the borderland of things, just as their theory was on the borderland of thought.","Chacun de ces personnages paraissait situe a l'extreme frontiere des choses, de meme que leur theorie etait a l'extreme frontiere de la pensee.",967,aligned
"He knew that each one of these men stood at the extreme end, so to speak, of some wild road of reasoning.",Il savait que chacun de ces hommes se tenait pour ainsi dire au point extreme de quelque route sauvage de la pensee.,968,aligned
"He could only fancy, as in some old-world fable, that if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find something say a tree that was more or less than a tree, a tree possessed by a spirit;","-- Un homme, songeait Syme, qui marcherait toujours vers l'ouest jusqu'au bout du monde, finirait sans doute par trouver quelque chose, par exemple un arbre, qui serait a la fois plus et moins qu'un arbre, soit un arbre possede par des esprits.",969,aligned
"and that if he went east to the end of the world he would find something else that was not wholly itself a tower, perhaps, of which the very shape was wicked.","~~~ Et, de meme, en allant toujours vers l'est, jusqu'au bout du monde, il rencontrerait une certaine chose qui ne serait pas non plus tout a fait cette chose meme, une tour peut-etre, dont l'architecture deja serait un peche.",970,aligned
and over their bacon and eggs upon their sunny balcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should die.,"et, sur le balcon ensoleille, en consommant leur jambon et leurs oeufs, ces joyeux conspirateurs decidaient la mort de l'un et de l'autre.",971,aligned
"Only three days afterwards the Czar was to meet the President of the French Republic in Paris,","Dans trois jours, le Tsar devait rencontrer le President de la Republique francaise a Paris,",972,aligned
The waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly when he said that they were talking about bombs and kings.,Le garcon ne se trompait pas en disant qu'il s'agissait de bombes et de rois.,973,aligned
They were deep in the discussion of an actual and immediate plot.,"Ils parlaient, a fond, d'un complot a realiser sans remise.",974,aligned
and not the least of the contrasts of that bewildering breakfast-table was the contrast between the easy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its terrible purport.,et le ton aise et enjoue des causeurs faisait avec le sujet de l'entretien le plus etonnant des contrastes que reunissait cet etonnant dejeuner.,975,aligned
Talk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene;,"La conversation ne s'etait pas interrompue,",976,aligned
The ends of the earth were closing in.,En eux les deux bouts du monde se rejoignaient.,977,aligned
"So these figures seemed to stand up, violent and unaccountable, against an ultimate horizon, visions from the verge.","C'est ainsi que les membres du Conseil, avec leurs silhouettes violentes et incomprehensibles, etaient pour Syme de vivantes visions de l'abime, et se detachaient sur un horizon ultime.",978,aligned
"Even the instrument was chosen; the black-bearded Marquis, it appeared, was to carry the bomb.",On designait meme le camarade qui jetterait la bombe : c'etait le marquis a la barbe noire.,979,aligned
"Very simply, he had no fear to spare for the French President or the Czar; he had begun to fear for himself.",Ce n'etait plus pour le Tsar et le President de la Republique qu'il tremblait : c'etait pour lui-meme.,980,aligned
"Most of the talkers took little heed of him, debating now with their faces closer together, and almost uniformly grave, save when for an instant the smile of the Secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky.","La plupart des anarchistes, passionnement interesses par la discussion, ne se preoccupaient guere de Syme. ~~~ Serres les uns contre les autres, ils etaient tous tres graves. A peine le rictus du secretaire passait-il parfois sur son visage, comme un eclair dans le ciel.",981,aligned
"But there was one persistent thing which first troubled Syme and at last terrified him. The President was always looking at him, steadily, and with a great and baffling interest.","Mais Syme fit une remarque qui d'abord le troubla et bientot le terrifia : le President ne cessait de le regarder fixement, de le devisager, avec un interet persistant.",982,aligned
He would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas.,Il n'aurait plus pense qu'a la necessite de sauver les deux hommes des fragments de fer et de la deflagration de la poudre qui menacait de les dechiqueter.,983,aligned
"But the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear, more piercing and practical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility.","Mais le fait est qu'en ce moment precis, il commencait a ressentir une crainte personnelle, immediate, ou s'evanouissaient ses sentiments de repulsion et meme le souci de ses responsabilites sociales.",984,aligned
"Ordinarily speaking, the proximity of this positive and objective crime would have sobered Syme, and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors.","Dans des circonstances moins extraordinaires, l'imminence de la realite objective, positive, du crime aurait calme Syme et dissipe ses craintes purement mystiques.",985,aligned
"The enormous man was quite quiet, but his blue eyes stood out of his head. ~~~ And they were always fixed on Syme.","L'enorme individu restait parfaitement calme ; mais ses yeux bleus lui sortaient de la tete, et ces terribles yeux etaient fixes sur Syme.",986,aligned
Syme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony.,"Syme eprouva un desir presque irresistible de sauter dans la rue, par-dessus le balcon.",987,aligned
When the President's eyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass. ~~~ He had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way Sunday had found out that he was a spy.,"Il se sentait transparent comme le verre pour les prunelles aigues de Dimanche et ne doutait plus que sa qualite d'espion, de quelque silencieuse et extraordinaire facon, n'eut ete eventee par cet homme redoutable.",988,aligned
"He looked over the edge of the balcony, and saw a policeman, standing abstractedly just beneath, staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees.","Il jeta un regard par-dessus la balustrade du balcon et vit, juste en bas, un policeman qui considerait distraitement les grilles du square et les arbres ensoleilles.",989,aligned
Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days.,Il eut alors une intense tentation qui devait plus d'une fois le hanter durant les jours qui suivirent.,990,aligned
"In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men, who were the princes of anarchy, he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet Gregory, the mere aesthete of anarchism.","Dans la compagnie de ces etres hideux, repugnants et puissants, de ces princes de l'anarchie, il avait jusqu'alors presque oublie ce personnage falot, le poete Gregory, simple esthete de l'anarchie.",991,aligned
"He even thought of him now with an old kindness, as if they had played together when children.","Il se ressouvenait de lui, maintenant, avec une sorte de sympathie, comme d'un ami avec lequel il aurait joue, jadis, dans son enfance.",992,aligned
He had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing.,il lui avait promis de ne pas faire precisement ce qu'il avait ete sur le point de faire.,993,aligned
He took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade.,Il retira sa main glacee de la froide balustrade de pierre.,994,aligned
He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman.,"Il lui avait promis de ne pas enjamber le balcon, de ne pas appeler ce policeman.",995,aligned
But he remembered that he was still tied to Gregory by a great promise.,Mais il se rappelait aussi qu'il restait lie a Gregory par une promesse intransgressible :,996,aligned
His soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision.,Son ame roulait dans un vertige d'indecision.,997,aligned
"He had only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous society, and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square beneath him.","Il n'avait qu'a violer un serment inconsidere, prete a une societe de bandits, et sa vie devenait aussi belle et riante que ce square ensoleille.",998,aligned
"He had, on the other hand, only to keep his antiquated honour, and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great enemy of mankind, whose very intellect was a torture-chamber.","D'autre part, s'il restait fidele aux lois antiques de l'honneur, il se livrait peu a peu sans recours a ce grand ennemi de l'humanite dont l'evidente et immense intelligence etait une chambre de torture.",999,aligned
"Whenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman, a pillar of common sense and common order.","Chaque fois qu'il se tournait vers le square, il voyait le policeman, confortable comme un pilier du sens commun et de l'ordre public.",1000,aligned
"Whenever he looked back at the breakfast-table he saw the President still quietly studying him with big, unbearable eyes.","Et, chaque fois que le regard de Syme revenait a la table, il voyait le President qui continuait a l'epier, de ses gros yeux insupportables.",1001,aligned
In all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that never crossed his mind.,"Il est deux idees, cependant, qui, dans le torrent de ses pensees, ne lui vinrent pas a l'esprit.",1002,aligned
"Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident, by hypnotism or by fire from hell, Sunday could certainly strike him.","Poison anonyme ou brusque accident, fortuit en apparence, hypnotisme, feu infernal : peu importait comment, mais certainement Dimanche pouvait le frapper.",1003,aligned
"But Sunday was not the man who would carry himself thus easily without having, somehow or somewhere, set open his iron trap.","Mais Dimanche n'etait pas homme a montrer tant d'aisance sans avoir, quelque part et de quelque maniere, prepare son piege.",1004,aligned
"The place might be public, the project might seem impossible.","Sans doute, sur une place publique une telle execution eut pu paraitre impossible.",1005,aligned
"First, it never occurred to him to doubt that the President and his Council could crush him if he continued to stand alone.","D'abord, il ne lui arriva pas un instant de mettre en doute que le President et son Conseil ne pussent l'aneantir, s'il restait la, seul, parmi ces miserables.",1006,aligned
"If he defied the man he was probably dead, either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent ailment.","Que Syme osat defier cet homme, et Syme etait condamne -- atteint de paralysie sur son siege ou mourant longtemps apres de quelque maladie mysterieuse.",1007,aligned
"If he called in the police promptly, arrested everyone, told all, and set against them the whole energy of England, he would probably escape; certainly not otherwise.","En appelant sur-le-champ la police, en faisant arreter tout le monde, en racontant tout, en suscitant contre ces monstres toute l'energie de l'Angleterre, peut-etre eut-il echappe.",1008,aligned
Mais son salut n'exigeait certainement pas moins.,(No direct equivalent in text),1009,not aligned
"He might have been called something above man, with his large plans, which were too obvious to be detected, with his large face, which was too frank to be understood.","Oui, cet etre aux plans vastes, trop visibles pour etre vus, au visage trop ouvert, trop explicite pour qu'on le comprit, pouvait faire penser qu'il y avait la plus qu'un homme.",1010,aligned
"If any such creature be conceivable, he looked, indeed, somewhat like it, with his earth-shaking abstraction, as of a stone statue walking.","Et, en effet, si le Surhomme est concevable, Dimanche lui ressemblait beaucoup, avec son energie capable d'ebranler la terre dans un moment de distraction. C'etait une statue de pierre en mouvement.",1011,aligned
They might have called Sunday the super-man.,Ils auraient salue en lui le Surhomme.,1012,aligned
"Many moderns, inured to a weak worship of intellect and force, might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality.","Beaucoup d'autres, en ce temps, habitues a honorer de toute leur faiblesse l'intelligence et la force, auraient pu hesiter dans leur loyaute, ceder au prestige oppressif de la puissante personnalite de Dimanche.",1013,aligned
It never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy.,(No direct equivalent in text),1014,not aligned
There was a second thought that never came to him.,Et il n'eut pas davantage l'idee qu'il pourrait etre gagne a l'ennemi.,1015,aligned
They were a balconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square; but he felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boatful of armed pirates overlooking an empty sea.,"Il y avait la, sur un balcon, au-dessus d'un square passager, quelques gentlemen, parmi lesquels Syme ne se sentait pas plus en securite qu'il ne l'eut ete, au milieu de la mer deserte, dans une chaloupe pleine de pirates armes.",1016,aligned
But this was a kind of modern meanness to which Syme could not sink even in his extreme morbidity.,"Mais Syme, quelle que fut la depression dont il souffrit, n'etait pas expose a tomber dans cette faiblesse, si moderne.",1017,aligned
"Like any man, he was coward enough to fear great force; but he was not quite coward enough to admire it.","Comme tout le monde, il etait assez lache pour craindre la force ; il n'etait pas tout a fait assez lache pour l'admirer.",1018,aligned
"""You are wrong,"" said the Secretary, drawing his black brows together.","-- Vous avez tort, protesta le secretaire en froncant les sourcils.",1019,aligned

"""Every man knows in his heart,"" he said, ""that nothing is worth doing.""","-- Chacun sait, dit-il, chacun sait, au fond de son coeur, que rien ne vaut aucun effort.",1022,aligned
It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians.,Un aussi parfait symbole de l'anarchie que peut l'etre l'encens pour les prieres des chretiens.,1023,aligned
"It expands; it only destroys because it broadens; even so, thought only destroys because it broadens.",La dynamite se repand et ne tue que parce qu'elle se repand. La pensee aussi ne detruit que parce qu'elle se repand.,1024,aligned
"A man's brain is a bomb,"" he cried out, loosening suddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with violence.",Le cerveau est une bombe !,1025,aligned

"President Sunday had risen to his feet, seeming to fill the sky above them.","Le President Dimanche s'etait leve, et il n'y avait plus de ciel au-dessus du balcon.",1036,aligned
The speech was broken off short under a vast shadow.,Le secretaire s'interrompit brusquement : une ombre vaste venait de s'allonger sur la table.,1037,aligned

"There was a singular silence, and then the Secretary said ""We are wandering, however, from the point.","Il se fit un etrange silence, puis : -- Nous nous ecartons de la question, observa le secretaire.",1040,aligned
"And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round.""",Quelle exquise sensation ! Enfoncer un couteau dans le dos d'un President de la Republique et retourner le fer dans la plaie !,1041,aligned
"""I have often wondered,"" said the Marquis, taking a great bite out of a slice of bread and jam, ""whether it wouldn't be better for me to do it with a knife.","-- Je me suis demande souvent, dit le marquis, en mordant dans une tartine de confiture, si je ne ferais pas mieux d'employer le couteau, de preference a la bombe.",1042,aligned
Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife.,Le couteau a servi a couper d'excellentes choses.,1043,aligned
"The men were eating as they talked, and even in this they were typical.","Les anarchistes mangeaient en causant, et jusque dans leur maniere de manger se revelait le caractere de chacun.",1044,aligned
Dr. Bull and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally of the best things on the table cold pheasant or Strasbourg pie.,"Le docteur Bull et le marquis chipotaient avec negligence les meilleurs morceaux, du faisan froid, du pate de Strasbourg.",1045,aligned
The old Professor had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood.,Le vieux professeur avait des hoquets precurseurs d'un prochain gatisme.,1046,aligned
And even in this President Sunday preserved his curious predominance of mere mass.,"Le President gardait, la comme en tout, la superiorite incontestable de sa masse.",1047,aligned
"For he ate like twenty men; he ate incredibly, with a frightful freshness of appetite, so that it was like watching a sausage factory.",Il mangeait comme vingt ! Il mangeait incroyablement !,1048,aligned
"But the Secretary was a vegetarian, and he spoke earnestly of the projected murder over half a raw tomato and three quarters of a glass of tepid water.","Le secretaire etait vegetarien, et discutait de bombes et de meurtres tout en absorbant une tomate crue, arrosee d'un verre d'eau tiede.",1049,aligned
"Yet continually, when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a quart of coffee, he would be found with his great head on one side staring at Syme.","On eut cru en le regardant devorer, assister a la manoeuvre d'une fabrique de saucisses.

"I have something very particular to say.""",J'ai une communication tres speciale a vous faire.,1051,aligned

"Syme stood up taut, as if it had been a bugle before the battle.","Syme se redressa fierement, comme s'il eut entendu le clairon sonner la bataille.",1054,aligned
A barrel-organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune.,"Soudain, dans la rue voisine, un orgue de Barbarie attaqua une ritournelle.",1055,aligned
"The instant of choice had come at last, the pistol was at his head.",Le moment de choisir etait venu ; le pistolet etait sur sa tempe.,1056,aligned
"On the pavement before he could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp, for the morning, though bright, was cold.","En bas, le policeman se promenait paresseusement tout en tapant de la semelle, car la matinee etait belle, mais froide.",1057,aligned
"That jingling music seemed full of the vivacity, the vulgarity, and the irrational valour of the poor, who in all those unclean streets were all clinging to the decencies and the charities of Christendom.","Il y avait pour lui, dans cette humble melodie, toute la vivacite, toute la vulgarite aussi, et toute l'irrationnelle vertu des pauvres qui, par les rues souillees de Londres, vont au hasard des pas, fermement attaches aux decences et aux charites du Christianisme.",1058,aligned
"His youthful prank of being a policeman had faded from his mind; he did not think of himself as the representative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy constables, or of the old eccentric who lived in the dark room.","Sa juvenile equipee de policier benevole, il n'y songeait plus ; il ne se concevait plus lui-meme comme le representant d'une association de gentlemen jouant en amateurs le role de detectives ; il avait oublie le vieil original qui vivait dans sa chambre pleine de nuit. ~~~ Non !",1059,aligned
"But he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street, who every day marched into battle to the music of the barrel-organ.","Il etait l'ambassadeur de tous ces pauvres gens, honnetes et vulgaires, qui, par les rues, s'en vont a la bataille de la vie, chaque matin, au son de l'orgue de Barbarie.",1060,aligned
He felt towards them all that unconscious and elementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts or a wise man over powerful errors.,"Il avait sur eux tous cette inconsciente et elementaire superiorite d'un brave homme sur des betes puissantes, d'un sage sur des erreurs puissantes.",1061,aligned
"For an instant, at least, he looked down upon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle of the commonplace.","Un instant, du moins, il jugea leur bizarrerie ignoble, du haut de ce point de vue celeste : le lieu commun.",1062,aligned
And this high pride in being human had lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the monstrous men around him.,"Et cette grande gloire d'etre simplement un homme l'exaltait, sans qu'il put dire pourquoi ni comment, a une hauteur incommensurable au-dessus des monstres qui l'entouraient.",1063,aligned
He knew that he had neither the intellectual nor the physical strength of President Sunday; but in that moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not the muscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros.,"Il ne possedait, sans doute, et il le savait bien, ni la force intellectuelle ni la force physique du President Dimanche ; mais il n'etait pas plus sensible a cette inferiorite qu'il n'eut regrette de ne pas avoir les muscles du tigre ou l'appendice nasal du rhinoceros.",1064,aligned
All was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong and that the barrel-organ was right.,Il oubliait tout devant cette certitude supreme : que Dimanche avait tort et que l'orgue de Barbarie avait raison.,1065,aligned
"There clanged in his mind that unanswerable and terrible truism in the song of Roland ""Pa ens ont tort et Chr tiens ont droit.""",Dans sa memoire chantait le truisme sans replique et terrible de la Chanson de Roland : Paiens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit !,1066,aligned
which in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great iron.,"qui etait, en ce vieux francais nasillard, pareil au bruit des grandes armes de fer.",1067,aligned
This liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness went with a quite clear decision to embrace death.,"Le fardeau de sa faiblesse se detachait de lui, et, fermement, il prit la resolution d'affronter la mort.",1068,aligned
"If the people of the barrel-organ could keep their old-world obligations, so could he.","Il songea que les gens de l'orgue de Barbarie tenaient leurs engagements, selon les lois de l'honneur antique ; il ferait comme eux.",1069,aligned
This very pride in keeping his word was that he was keeping it to miscreants.,"La fidelite a sa parole serait d'autant plus glorieuse qu'il l'avait donnee, cette parole d'honneur, a des mecreants.",1070,aligned
It was his last triumph over these lunatics to go down into their dark room and die for something that they could not even understand.,Et son dernier triomphe sur ces fous serait de les suivre dans ce cabinet particulier et de mourir pour une cause qu'ils ne pourraient meme pas comprendre.,1071,aligned
"The barrel-organ seemed to give the marching tune with the energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra; and he could hear deep and rolling, under all the trumpets of the pride of life, the drums of the pride of death.","L'orgue de Barbarie jouait une marche avec toute l'energie et toute la parfaite harmonie d'un savant orchestre ; et Syme distinguait, sous les eclats des cuivres qui celebraient la gloire de vivre, le profond roulement de tambour qui affirmait la gloire de mourir.",1072,aligned

"The President led them down an irregular side stair, such as might be used by servants, and into a dim, cold, empty room, with a table and benches, like an abandoned boardroom.","Le President les conduisit, par un escalier de service, dans une chambre vide, froide, mal eclairee.

"But Syme saw little of the scene, for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness;",Mais Syme ne vit pas grand'chose de ce qui se passa ensuite. Il etait comme aveugle par une obscurite bienfaisante.,1121,aligned
Even the Professor made an effort to rise.,Le professeur lui-meme fit un effort pour se lever.,1122,aligned
With the same flash three men sprang at his throat.,"Au meme instant, trois hommes lui sautaient a la gorge.",1123,aligned
"Gogol sprang to his feet, a pistol in each hand.","Gogol se dressa sur ses pieds, un revolver dans chaque main.",1124,aligned

"he had sunk down into his seat shuddering, in a palsy of passionate relief.","Effondre sur son banc, il tremblait, comme epouvante de se sentir sauve.",1129,aligned
"The alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair, but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card.",Le pretendu Polonais avait pali sous sa broussaille de poils sombres. ~~~ Il glissa pourtant avec calme apparent deux doigts dans la poche indiquee et en tira un bout de carte bleue.,1130,aligned
"When Syme saw it lying on the table, he woke up again to the world outside him.","En voyant cette carte sur la table, Syme reprit conscience du monde exterieur.",1131,aligned
"For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table, and he could read nothing of the inscription on it, it bore a startling resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket, the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti-anarchist constabulary.","Bien qu'elle fut posee a l'autre bout de la table, et qu'il n'en put pas lire l'inscription, cette carte ressemblait etonnamment a celle qu'il avait lui-meme en poche et qui lui avait ete remise a son entree dans la police antianarchiste.",1132,aligned

"""I concede the point,"" said Sunday.",-- Je vous accorde ce point.,1148,aligned

The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments.,"Il me serait donc desagreable, pendant au moins deux minutes et demie, d'apprendre que vous avez succombe aux tourments.",1150,aligned
"Well, if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us, I shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort.","Eh bien ! ~~~ si vous parlez de nous a la police ou a ame qui vive, il me faudra subir ces deux minutes et demie de desagrement.",1151,aligned

"The red-haired detective who had masqueraded as Gogol rose to his feet without a word, and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance.","Le ci-devant Gogol, le detective aux cheveux roux se leva sans mot dire et quitta la chambre, lentement, avec un air de parfaite nonchalance.",1155,aligned

"The Professor went last, very slowly and painfully.","Le professeur gagna la porte tres lentement, tres peniblement.",1159,aligned

"Yet the astonished Syme was able to realise that this ease was suddenly assumed; for there was a slight stumble outside the door, which showed that the departing detective had not minded the step.","Mais Syme, stupefait, put se convaincre que cette aisance etait jouee, car un leger trebuchement l'avertit bientot que le detective n'avait pas pris garde a l'escalier.",1174,aligned
"Syme alone had even a glimmering, and such as it was it froze him to the bone.","Syme seul se doutait de la verite, et ce doute le faisait frissonner jusque dans la moelle de ses os.",1175,aligned
The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger.,Le secretaire etouffa un rugissement de fureur.,1176,aligned
"And with these words he shouldered his way out of the room, shaking with incomprehensible scorn.","Sur ces mots, il quitta la piece en haussant les epaules.",1177,aligned
"Why, you dancing donkey,"" he roared, rising, ""you didn't want to be overheard by a spy, didn't you? How do you know you aren't overheard now?""","ane bate que vous etes ! rugit-il en se levant. Vous ne vouliez pas qu'un espion nous entendit, hein ? Or, que savez-vous si, en ce moment meme, un espion ne nous entend pas ?",1178,aligned
"""That's it, that's it,"" said the President, nodding a great many times. ""That's where you fail right enough. You fail to understand.","-- Parfaitement, dit le President en inclinant la tete a plusieurs reprises, c'est bien cela ! vous ne pouvez comprendre, et cela vous arrive assez souvent. Voyons !",1179,aligned
"He had escaped a thunderbolt, but he was still under a cloud.","Il avait echappe au premier coup de tonnerre, mais le nuage pesait encore sur lui.",1180,aligned
"His top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father Christmas, the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles; but it seemed as if nothing could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress.","Son chapeau etait blanc comme celui du pere Noel, et la neige s'epaississait autour de ses souliers. Mais il semblait que rien ne put l'arracher a la contemplation de cette poupee fanee.",1181,aligned
At last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into Leicester Square.,"Enfin, il sortit et gagna Leicester Square.",1182,aligned
"The bright, cold day had grown increasingly colder, and when he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow.",La temperature s'etait refroidie. Syme eprouva quelque ennui a voir tomber des flocons de neige.,1183,aligned
"While he still carried the sword-stick and the rest of Gregory's portable luggage, he had thrown the cloak down and left it somewhere, perhaps on the steam-tug, perhaps on the balcony.","Il avait toujours la canne a epee et le reste des bagages de Gregory, mais sa pelerine etait restee il ne savait ou, dans le bateau peut-etre, ou sur le balcon.",1184,aligned
It was quite strange that any human being should stand in such weather observing such a shop.,Il etait assez etrange qu'un etre humain quelconque se tint par un pareil temps en observation devant une telle boutique.,1185,aligned
"Hoping, therefore, that the snow-shower might be slight, he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway of a small and greasy hair-dresser's shop, the front window of which was empty, except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress.","Esperant que la rafale ne durerait pas, il se refugia sous l'auvent d'une petite boutique de coiffeur, dont la vitrine ne contenait qu'une maladive figure de femme en cire, decolletee.",1186,aligned
"He was considerably astonished to see, standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window, a man.","Il ne fut pas peu surpris de voir un homme arrete devant la vitrine et qui se tenait la, immobile, comme hypnotise par l'insupportable statuette.",1187,aligned
"Snow, however, began to thicken and fall fast; and Syme, having found one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits, stared out instead into the white and empty street.","Pourtant, la neige tombait de plus en plus dense. Syme, agace par le sourire fade de la figurine, se retourna vers la rue et regarda les paves blanchir.",1188,aligned
That any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to Syme; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock; for he realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old Professor de Worms.,"L'etonnement de Syme ne tarda pas a changer en un malaise tres personnel, car il reconnut tout a coup le vieux professeur paralytique de Worms.",1189,aligned
It scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities.,"Ce n'etait guere l'endroit qui convenait a un homme de son age, accable des infirmites qu'il avait.",1190,aligned
"For Syme thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere, if only for an hour.","Car Syme avait besoin d'echapper, ne fut-ce que pour une heure, a l'atmosphere empoisonnee qu'il respirait depuis la veille.",1191,aligned
Syme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood;,Syme etait pret a admettre n'importe quoi d'invraisemblable sur le compte de n'importe lequel des << deshumanises >> qui composaient le Conseil.,1192,aligned
but even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in love with that particular wax lady.,Mais il ne pouvait croire que le vieux professeur fut amoureux de cette poupee de cire.,1193,aligned
He could only suppose that the man's malady (whatever it was) involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance.,"Il prefera s'expliquer le cas en supposant que le malade etait sujet a des acces de catalepsie, de rigidite subite,",1194,aligned
"He was not inclined, however, to feel in this case any very compassionate concern.","et meme il se felicita, n'etant nullement enclin a la pitie envers un tel individu,",1195,aligned
"On the contrary, he rather congratulated himself that the Professor's stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind.","de pouvoir, par une fuite rapide, le distancer tout de suite.",1196,aligned
"Then he could collect his thoughts, formulate his policy, and decide finally whether he should or should not keep faith with Gregory.","Alors, il pourrait, du moins, mettre de l'ordre dans ses pensees, deliberer sur la conduite a tenir, et d'abord resoudre ce probleme : etait-il, ou non, enchaine par la parole donnee a Gregory ?",1197,aligned
"He strolled away through the dancing snow, turned up two or three streets, down through two or three others, and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch.","Sous les flocons de neige qui dansaient dans l'air, il s'eloigna, traversa quelques rues et entra dans un petit restaurant de Soho pour y prendre son lunch.",1198,aligned
"He partook reflectively of four small and quaint courses, drank half a bottle of red wine, and ended up over black coffee and a black cigar, still thinking.","Il mangea de trois ou quatre plats, tout en reflechissant, but une demi-bouteille de vin rouge et termina par une tasse de cafe accompagnee d'un cigare.",1199,aligned
When he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot.,"En penetrant dans cette piece, il crut sentir que ses pieds prenaient racine dans le plancher.",1200,aligned
But even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape.,"Mais, tout en frissonnant, il songea aussi qu'il avait fui, et il en eut une impression melee de quelque honte et de beaucoup de plaisir.",1201,aligned
"He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant, which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners.","Il avait choisi sa place dans la salle du premier etage, ou retentissaient indiscontinument le cliquetis des couteaux et des fourchettes et le bruit des conversations, en langues etrangeres.",1202,aligned
He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists.,"Il se rappela que, jadis, il avait soupconne d'anarchisme ces braves et inoffensifs etrangers,",1203,aligned
"He shuddered, remembering the real thing.",et il frissonna en songeant a ce que c'etait qu'un veritable anarchiste.,1204,aligned
For an instant Syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon.,"Un instant, Syme resta droit, rigide comme la canne sur laquelle il s'appuyait.",1205,aligned
"The wine, the common food, the familiar place, the faces of natural and talkative men, made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream;","Le vin, la nourriture, qui n'avait rien d'extraordinaire, le caractere familier de l'endroit, les visages de ces hommes bavards et simples, tout le rassurait, et il etait tente de croire que le Conseil des Sept n'etait qu'un mauvais reve !",1206,aligned
"and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality, it was at least a distant one.","Bien qu'il fut oblige de convenir en lui-meme que le terrible Conseil n'avait rien de chimerique, ce n'etait, du moins, pour l'instant, qu'une realite lointaine.",1207,aligned
Tall houses and populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven;,"De grandes maisons, des rues populeuses, le separaient des maudits Sept.",1208,aligned
"he was free in free London, and drinking wine among the free.","Il etait libre, dans une ville libre, et il buvait son vin parmi des hommes libres.",1209,aligned
"With a somewhat easier action, he took his hat and stick and strolled down the stair into the shop below.","Avec un soupir de soulagement, il prit son chapeau et sa canne, et descendit dans la salle du rez-de-chaussee, qu'il devait traverser pour sortir.",1210,aligned
"At a small table, close up to the blank window and the white street of snow, sat the old anarchist Professor over a glass of milk, with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids.","A une petite table, tout pres de la fenetre et de la rue blanche de neige, le vieux professeur anarchiste etait assis devant un verre de lait, avec ses paupieres mi-closes, et son visage livide.",1211,aligned
"Then with a gesture as of blind hurry, he brushed past the Professor, dashing open the door and slamming it behind him, and stood outside in the snow.","Puis, avec une precipitation folle, il passa tout pres du professeur, ouvrit la porte et, la faisant claquer derriere lui, bondit dans la rue, dans la neige.",1212,aligned
"""Can that old corpse be following me?""",-- Ce cadavre me suivrait-il ?,1213,aligned
"he asked himself, biting his yellow moustache.",se demandait Syme en mordillant sa moustache blonde.,1214,aligned
"""I stopped too long up in that room, so that even such leaden feet could catch me up.","Je me suis trop attarde, je lui ai donne le temps de me rejoindre malgre ses pieds de plomb.",1215,aligned
But the Professor did not look round.,Le professeur ne parut pas avoir entendu.,1216,aligned
"Syme's walking-stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang, which confessed the concealed steel.",La canne de Syme lui echappa des mains et fit en tombant un bruit metallique qui revela la presence de l'epee.,1217,aligned
"One comfort is, with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo.","Heureusement qu'en hatant un peu le pas, je puis sans peine mettre entre lui et moi la distance d'ici a Tombouctou...",1218,aligned
Was he really following me?,Pourquoi me suivrait-il ?,1219,aligned
"Syme, who was commonly a cool character, was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick.","Syme qui etait un homme plutot calme le regardait, bouche bee, comme un paysan qui assiste a un tour de passe-passe.",1220,aligned
He had seen no cab following; he had heard no wheels outside the shop; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot.,"Il n'avait remarque aucun cab derriere lui ; il n'en avait pas entendu s'arreter devant la boutique. Selon toute apparence, le professeur etait venu a pied.",1221,aligned
"But the old man could only walk like a snail, and Syme had walked like the wind!","~~~ Mais quoi ? Le vieillard n'allait guere plus vite qu'un escargot, et Syme avait file comme le vent ! ~~~",1222,aligned
"He started up and snatched his stick, half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic, and swung out of the swinging doors, leaving his coffee untasted.","Affole par l'invraisemblance materielle du fait, il se leva, ramassa sa canne et s'esquiva, sans avoir touche a son cafe.",1223,aligned
An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with an unusual rapidity.,Un omnibus se dirigeant vers la Banque passait a grande allure.,1224,aligned
"He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it; but he managed to spring, swaying upon the splash-board and, pausing for an instant to pant, he climbed on to the top.","Syme dut faire une centaine de pas en courant pour l'atteindre. ~~~ Il sauta sur le marchepied, respira un instant, puis monta a l'imperiale.",1225,aligned
Or am I too fanciful?,"Du reste, ma supposition n'est pas raisonnable.",1226,aligned
"When he had been seated for about half a minute, he heard behind him a sort of heavy and asthmatic breathing.","Il y etait installe depuis une demi-minute, a peu pres, quand il entendit venir d'en bas un souffle d'asthmatique.",1227,aligned
"He let himself into a seat with characteristic care, and wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug.","Il s'avanca a tout petits pas, se laissa tomber sur la banquette en poussant de legers soupirs et s'enveloppa lentement dans les plis de la bache de laine.",1228,aligned
"Scarcely had he done so, when Professor de Worms hobbled heavily into the shop, sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk.","A peine l'avait-il commandee que le professeur de Worms, peniblement et en trebuchant, ouvrait la porte de la boutique et, s'asseyant avec difficulte, demandait une tasse de lait.",1229,aligned
"Getting into his eyes and beard, they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves; and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street, he lost patience, and finding a Sunday teashop, turned into it to take shelter.","~~~ A l'entree de Fleet Street, il perdit patience, et, se trouvant devant une maison de the ouverte le dimanche, il s'y refugia.",1230,aligned
The snow-flakes tormented him like a swarm of silver bees.,"Les flocons le piquaient comme d'innombrables essaims d'abeilles argentees, penetrant dans ses yeux, dans sa barbe, surexcitant ses nerfs deja fort tendus.",1231,aligned
"As he crossed the great market the snow increased, growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken.","Comme il traversait le Grand Marche, la rafale de neige se fit plus abondante. Elle devenait aveuglante a mesure que le jour baissait.",1232,aligned
"He set off at a smart pace, twisting and whirling his stick, in the direction of Covent Garden.","D'un bon pas, tout en faisant tournoyer sa canne entre ses doigts, il prit la direction de Covent Garden.",1233,aligned
"Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man?""","Si Dimanche me faisait surveiller, il n'aurait pas charge de cette mission un paralytique.",1234,aligned
"Turning sharply, he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow, and under the shadow of its brim the short-sighted face and shaky shoulders of Professor de Worms.","Se retournant aussitot, il vit s'elever graduellement sur les marches de l'omnibus un chapeau haut de forme, blanc de neige, puis le visage de myope, puis les epaules tremblantes du vieux professeur de Worms.",1235,aligned
He ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse.,"Par contenance, il commanda une seconde tasse de cafe noir.",1236,aligned
"Every movement of the old man's tottering figure and vague hands, every uncertain gesture and panic-stricken pause, seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless, that he was in the last imbecility of the body.","Chaque mouvement de ce corps branlant, le moindre de ses gestes demontrait jusqu'a la parfaite evidence la debilite sans remede, la totale impuissance de cet organisme use.",1237,aligned
He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the side.,"Il avait du reprimer un mouvement impulsif qu'il avait eu de se jeter en bas, du haut de l'imperiale.",1238,aligned
"Syme sprang erect upon the rocking car, and after staring wildly at the wintry sky, that grew gloomier every moment, he ran down the steps.","Syme se dressa de toute sa hauteur et, jetant un regard affole sur ce ciel d'hiver, qui d'instant en instant devenait plus sombre, se laissa glisser, plutot qu'il ne descendit, le long de l'escalier.",1239,aligned
"And yet, unless the philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical existence, it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after the omnibus.","Et pourtant, a moins d'admettre que les entites philosophiques appelees espace et temps fussent depourvues de toute realite, il etait infiniment probable que ce vieillard avait du courir apres l'omnibus.",1240,aligned
"Too bewildered to look back or to reason, he rushed into one of the little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole.","Sans regarder en arriere, sans reflechir, il s'engagea a l'aveuglette, comme un lievre dans un trou, dans l'une des petites cours qui avoisinent Fleet Street.",1241,aligned
"He moved by inches, he let himself down with little gasps of caution.",(No direct equivalent in text),1242,not aligned
"He had a vague idea, if this incomprehensible old Jack-in-the-box was really pursuing him, that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the scent.",Il avait vaguement l'idee de depister le vieux diable en se perdant lui-meme dans ce labyrinthe de ruelles etroites.,1243,aligned
"He dived in and out of those crooked lanes, which were more like cracks than thoroughfares; and by the time that he had completed about twenty alternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon, he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit.","Il se plongea donc dans ces ruelles qui semblaient des culs-de-sac plutot que des passages, et apres avoir tourne une vingtaine de coins et decrit quelque inimaginable polygone, au bout de quelques minutes, il s'arreta, pretant l'oreille.",1244,aligned
"There was none; there could not in any case have been much, for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow.","Aucun bruit de pas. ~~~ Du reste, la couche epaisse de neige dont ces ruelles etaient tapissees etouffait tous les bruits.",1245,aligned
"But right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral; and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow, still clinging as to an Alpine peak.","Sur ce fond morne, la masse noire de la cathedrale s'elevait, et a son sommet, on distinguait une grande tache de neige, comme sur un pic alpestre.",1246,aligned
"The sealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Paul's had in it smoky and sinister colours colours of sickly green, dead red or decaying bronze, that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow.","Derriere Saint-Paul, le soleil, comme un disque de metal, avait des teintes fumeuses et sinistres, morbides, des teintes d'un rouge fletri, d'un bronze terni, qui faisaient ressortir la blancheur opaque de la neige.",1247,aligned
"Under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight, as of men under the sea.","Sous l'epais brouillard qui planait, la ville prenait une etrange couleur verdatre et comme sous-marine.",1248,aligned
And at the very word Sunday he bit his lip; the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun.,"En prononcant tout bas ce mot, il se mordit la levre. Dimanche ! Ces syllabes comportaient desormais pour lui un jeu de mots sacrilege.",1249,aligned
"Then he told himself that some degree of emptiness was natural; first because the snow-storm was even dangerously deep, and secondly because it was Sunday.","Puis, il reflechit que la tempete de neige etait un danger. Enfin il se rappela que c'etait dimanche.",1250,aligned
"At first he was startled to find these great roads so empty, as if a pestilence had swept through the city.",Il fut d'abord etonne de la solitude de ces grandes voies. C'etait comme si la peste eut decime la population.,1251,aligned
"When he did so, he struck it much farther up than he had fancied. He came out into what seemed the vast and void of Ludgate Circus, and saw St. Paul's Cathedral sitting in the sky.","Mais il erra longtemps encore en tous sens avant de gagner la grande artere, et, quand il y parvint, il se trouva beaucoup plus loin qu'il n'aurait pense, dans la vaste solitude de Ludgate-Circus. Il apercut la cathedrale de Saint-Paul assise en plein ciel.",1252,aligned
Yet he rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare.,"Mais il erra longtemps encore en tous sens avant de gagner la grande artere, et, quand il y parvint, il se trouva beaucoup plus loin qu'il n'aurait pense, dans la vaste solitude de Ludgate-Circus.",1253,aligned
"He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses, and to get once more into the open and lamp-lit street.","Il eprouva de nouveau le besoin de gagner les rues larges et eclairees, de sortir de ce dedale de maisons tristes.",1254,aligned
On each side of Syme the walls of the alley were blind and featureless; there was no little window or any kind of eve.,"A la droite et a la gauche de Syme, les murs de l'allee etaient unis et sans caractere ; pas une fenetre, rien qui fit penser a un oeil.",1255,aligned
"But when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen, his heart stood still also, for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple.","Il n'en avait pas tenu grand compte d'abord. Et il allait reprendre sa course, quand son coeur cessa de battre : il entendait resonner, dans cet endroit deblaye, la bequille de l'infernal perclus.",1256,aligned
"He thought little of this as he passed it, only plunging into yet another arm of the maze.","Il n'en avait pas tenu grand compte d'abord. Et il allait reprendre sa course, quand son coeur cessa de battre : il entendait resonner, dans cet endroit deblaye, la bequille de l'infernal perclus.",1257,aligned
"Somewhere behind Red Lion Court, however, he noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards, leaving the wet, glistening cobble-stones.","Quelque part, toutefois, derriere Red Lion Court il avait remarque en passant qu'un citoyen energique avait balaye la neige sur l'espace d'une vingtaine de metres ; la le gravier apparaissait, humide et luisant.",1258,aligned
"The sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow, leaving London in a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the evening.","Le ciel, couvert de nuages, versait sur Londres un crepuscule dense, insolite a cette heure peu avancee de l'apres-midi.",1259,aligned
"It had fallen accidentally, but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point, and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross.","La masse neigeuse, apres s'etre lentement amoncelee, s'etait ecroulee, mais en s'ecroulant, elle avait drape le dome, du haut en bas, d'une echarpe blanche, de facon a faire saillir en argent pur le globe et la croix.",1260,aligned
"When Syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself, and made with his sword-stick an involuntary salute.","A cette vue, Syme se raidit involontairement, il fit de la canne-epee le salut militaire.",1261,aligned
"He knew that that evil figure, his shadow, was creeping quickly or slowly behind him, and he did not care.",Il savait que le hideux compere le suivait toujours comme son ombre ; mais il ne s'en souciait plus.,1262,aligned
It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright.,"C'etait comme un symbole de la foi et de la vertu, ce haut lieu de la terre qui restait resplendissant dans les cieux assombris.",1263,aligned
"The devils might have captured heaven, but they had not yet captured the cross.",Les demons pouvaient s'etre empares des cieux ; ils ne pouvaient toucher a la croix.,1264,aligned
"He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing, jumping and pursuing paralytic; and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned, stick in hand, to face his pursuer.","Syme eut brusquement l'envie d'arracher, a ce paralytique dansant et sautillant qui le poursuivait, son secret. ~~~ A l'angle du Circus, il se retourna, etreignant sa canne, pour faire face a son persecuteur.",1265,aligned
"Professor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind him, his unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas-lamp, irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in the nursery rhymes, ""the crooked man who went a crooked mile.""","Le professeur de Worms tourna lentement le coin de l'allee irreguliere d'ou il venait. ~~~ Sa forme outrageante, estompee contre un reverbere solitaire, rappela irresistiblement a Syme << le bonhomme tortu qui fit un mille tordu >>, dont il est question dans les chansons de nourrice.",1266,aligned
He really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading.,"On etait vraiment tente de croire que sa forme tordue lui avait ete donnee, imposee, par ces rues tortueuses.",1267,aligned
"He came nearer and nearer, the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles, his lifted, patient face.","Il se rapprochait, et la lumiere du reverbere se refletait sur son binocle releve, sur sa figure patiente, qu'il tenait droite, immobile.",1268,aligned
The man's colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident.,"Le vieillard semblait protester, tacitement, par son visage ferme, par ses manieres, en quelque sorte incolores, qu'il ne poursuivait personne et que toutes ces rencontres avaient ete de simples et insignifiantes coincidences.",1269,aligned
There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left Syme in a final fury.,"Ce silence, cette sorte d'innocence jouee, exaspererent Syme.",1270,aligned
Syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision.,"Syme se sentit galvanise par une soudaine energie, nuancee de fureur et d'ironie.",1271,aligned
"Syme waited for him as St. George waited for the dragon, as a man waits for a final explanation or for death.","Syme l'attendait comme saint Georges attendit le dragon, comme un homme qui va provoquer une explication finale, ou la mort.",1272,aligned
"And the old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger, without even a blink of his mournful eyelids.","Et le vieux professeur alla droit a Syme, et passa devant lui comme devant un inconnu, sans un regard de ses yeux eplores.",1273,aligned
"Concealment was impossible now; and looking back over his shoulder, he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long, swinging strides like a man winning a mile race.","Impossible maintenant de se cacher. En se retournant, il put voir le vieillard qui le poursuivait a grandes enjambees. ~~~ On eut dit deux hommes se defiant a la course. (The last part is a partial match, describing the chase)",1274,aligned
"He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man's hat off, called out something like ""Catch me if you can,"" and went racing away across the white, open Circus.","Il fit un geste violent, qui faillit faire tomber le chapeau du professeur, cria quelque chose comme : << Attrape-moi si tu peux ! >> et se mit a courir a travers le large et blanc Circus.",1275,aligned
"But the head upon that bounding body was still pale, grave and professional, like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin.","Mais la tete du professeur restait toujours livide, grave, immobile et, pour tout dire, professorale : la tete d'un conferencier plantee sur le corps d'un arlequin.",1276,aligned
"This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus, up Ludgate Hill, round St. Paul's Cathedral, along Cheapside, Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known.","Cette etrange course se continua sans repit a travers Ludgate-Circus, par Ludgate Hill, autour de la cathedrale de Saint-Paul, le long de Cheapside ; Syme croyait revivre tous les cauchemars oublies.",1277,aligned
"Then Syme broke away towards the river, and ended almost down by the docks.","Enfin, il se dirigea vers le fleuve et s'arreta tout pres des docks.",1278,aligned
"He saw the yellow panes of a low, lighted public-house, flung himself into it and ordered beer.","Il apercut les portes jaunes d'un bar illumine, s'y engouffra et commanda de la biere.",1279,aligned
"It was a foul tavern, sprinkled with foreign sailors, a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.","C'etait une taverne borgne, pleine de marins etrangers, un endroit, peut-etre, ou l'on fumait de l'opium, ou l'on jouait du couteau...",1280,aligned
"A moment later Professor de Worms entered the place, sat down carefully, and asked for a glass of milk.","L'instant d'apres le professeur de Worms entra, s'assit avec precaution, et commanda un verre de lait.",1281,aligned
"If the man had one character as a paralytic and another character as a pursuer, the antithesis might make him more interesting, but scarcely more soothing.","Qu'il eut le privilege de reunir en sa personne les deux caracteres du paralytique et du coureur, cela le rendait fort interessant, mais encore plus inquietant.",1282,aligned
"It would be a very small comfort that he could not find the Professor out, if by some serious accident the Professor should find him out.","La compensation serait mince, pour Syme, s'il parvenait a penetrer le mystere du professeur, pendant que, de son cote, le professeur lui arracherait son propre secret.",1283,aligned
"""But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy. Perhaps policeman is a relative term. In an evolutionary sense, sir, the ape fades so gradually into the policeman, that I myself can never detect the shade. The monkey is only the policeman that may be. Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham Common is only the policeman that might have been.'","-- Peut-etre certaines finesses de votre philosophie teutonique m'echappent-elles ? Peut-etre, dans votre esprit, << policeman >> est-il un terme tout relatif ? Du point de vue de l'evolution, monsieur, le singe se transforme en policeman par des degres si insensibles, que je n'aurai sans doute pas percu toutes ces delicates nuances. Le singe est le policeman qui sera peut-etre un jour. La vieille fille de Clapham Common est peut-etre le policeman qu'elle aurait pu etre.",1284,aligned
"The old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope, but Syme ran on with a feverish irony.","Le vieux professeur branlait la tete avec une gravite desesperante. Syme reprit, sur un ton d'ironie febrile :",1285,aligned
"Do, do let me be a postman.""",Pourquoi ne serais-je pas plutot un facteur ?,1286,aligned
"""Did I take a policeman's hat by mistake out of the restaurant?"" asked Syme, smiling wildly. ""Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere? Have my boots got that watchful look? Why must I be a policeman?","-- Aurais-je pris par erreur, en quittant le restaurant, le chapeau d'un policeman ? Porte-je quelque part sur moi un numero ?

"""The process was simple enough,"" answered the Professor patiently. ""I thought you looked like a policeman. I think so now.""","-- C'est tres simple, dit le professeur, avec insistance, vous avez l'air d'un policeman. Je l'ai vu tout de suite et je le vois encore.",1288,aligned
"""A policeman?"" he said, laughing vaguely.",-- Un policeman ! Un policeman !,1289,aligned
"""Whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me?""",Et il continuait de rire. Puis il reprit : -- Qu'y a-t-il donc en moi qui vous fasse penser a un policeman ?,1290,aligned
"Whatever else Syme had expected, he had never expected anything so brutal and actual as this.","Si pret a tout que fut Syme, il ne pouvait s'attendre a une telle question, si directe, si brutale.",1291,aligned
"This incomprehensible man from the fierce council, after all, had certainly pursued him.","Donc, et sans qu'aucun doute la-dessus fut possible, cet etre incomprehensible le poursuivait.",1292,aligned
"When Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair, and opposite to him, fixed and final also, the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the Professor, his fears fully returned.","Quand il se trouva assis enfin et en face de lui les sourcils leves du professeur qui le regardait fixement sous ses paupieres plombees, Syme se sentit de nouveau pris de terreur.",1293,aligned
He emptied a whole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk.,Syme avait deja vide son pot de biere : le verre de lait du professeur etait encore intact.,1294,aligned
"One possibility, however, kept him hopeful and yet helpless.","Une seule explication rassurante, mais si peu probable !",1295,aligned
Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity.,"Malgre toute sa presence d'esprit, il ne trouva sur le moment rien de mieux que de repeter, en eclatant de rire, d'un rire force :",1296,aligned
Perhaps it was some regular form or sign.,"peut-etre y avait-il la une sorte de rite, comme un signe de l'entree en fonctions du nouveau conseiller ;",1297,aligned
It was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him.,"Peut-etre le poursuivait-on sans l'epier, a proprement parler, sans le soupconner ;",1298,aligned

Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have understood.,"peut-etre le nouveau Jeudi etait-il et devait-il etre ainsi poursuivi le long de Cheapside, ainsi que le nouveau lord-maire y est escorte.",1303,aligned
I don't mind being the policeman that might have been.,Peu m'importe si j'ai l'aspect du policeman que j'aurais pu etre.,1304,aligned

It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself.,J'appris qu'un impertinent osait me parodier.,1487,aligned
"Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real Professor came into the room.""","Sur ces entrefaites, le professeur lui-meme entra ; toutes les personnes qui m'entouraient le toiserent, et je le considerai d'un regard glacial, les sourcils haut leves.",1488,aligned
"""I need hardly say there was a collision.",J'ai a peine besoin d'ajouter qu'il y eut une collision.,1489,aligned
The pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to see which was really the more feeble.,"Les pessimistes qui composaient la galerie consideraient tantot l'un, tantot l'autre des deux de Worms, se demandant lequel etait le plus impotent.",1490,aligned
But I won.,C'est moi qui gagnai.,1491,aligned
"An old man in poor health, like my rival, could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life.","Un vieillard de sante precaire, comme mon rival, ne pouvait donner aussi completement qu'un jeune acteur dans la force de l'age l'impression d'une agonie ambulante.",1492,aligned
"You see, he really had paralysis, and working within this definite limitation, he couldn't be so jolly paralytic as I was.","Il etait reellement paralytique, voyez-vous, tandis que, moi, je ne l'etais que pour mes spectateurs, et je le fus bien mieux et bien plus que lui.",1493,aligned
Then he tried to blast my claims intellectually.,Il voulut alors me battre sur le terrain philosophique.,1494,aligned
I countered that by a very simple dodge.,Je me defendis par une ruse bien simple.,1495,aligned
"Whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand, I replied with something which I could not even understand myself.","Chaque fois qu'il disait une chose incomprehensible pour tout autre que lui-meme, je ripostais par quelque chose que, moi-meme, je ne comprenais pas.",1496,aligned
"I don't fancy,' he said, that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation, since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna, which are an essential of differentiation.'","<< -- Je ne pense pas, me dit-il, que vous auriez su degager ce principe, a savoir que l'evolution est necessairement negative, parce qu'elle implique la supposition de lacunes essentielles a toute differenciation. >>",1497,aligned
"The real Professor was thrown out, but not with violence, though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose.","Le veritable professeur fut expulse, sans violence, toutefois, sauf qu'un energumene s'epuisa en patients efforts pour lui arracher son nez.",1498,aligned
"But I laughed heartily, answered, Like the Pantheist's boots,' at random, and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory.","<< -- Comme les bottes du partheiste ! >>, fis-je au hasard, en riant d'un air bonhomme, et, tournant peniblement sur mes talons, je m'eloignai, avec tous les honneurs de la victoire.",1499,aligned
"But the people all round (rather to my surprise) seemed to remember them quite well,",Mais je fus assez etonne de voir que les temoins paraissaient se souvenir parfaitement de ces auteurs.,1500,aligned
"and the Professor, finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples, fell back upon a more popular form of wit.","Le professeur, se voyant, en depit de sa methode savante et mysterieuse, a la merci d'un adversaire denue de scrupules, essaya de me desarconner par une plaisanterie :",1501,aligned
"I see,' he sneered, you prevail like the false pig in sop.'","<< -- Je vois, dit-il, que vous triomphez a la maniere du faux porc d'Esope ! --",1502,aligned
"And you fail,' I answered, smiling, like the hedgehog in Montaigne.'","Et vous, repliquai-je, vous etes battu comme le herisson de Montaigne. >>",1503,aligned
Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne?,"Je ne sache pas, je vous l'avoue, qu'il soit question de herisson dans Montaigne.",1504,aligned
"Your claptrap comes off,' he said; so would your beard.'","<< Voila que vous perdez vos moyens, dit-il, on pourrait en dire autant de votre barbe. >>",1505,aligned
"I had no intelligent answer to this, which was quite true and rather witty.","A cela je ne sus que dire. L'attaque etait trop directe, trop juste et assez spirituelle.",1506,aligned
It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe.,Inutile de vous dire que Prickwerts et Glumpe n'ont jamais existe.,1507,aligned
"I replied quite scornfully, You read all that up in Pinckwerts; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe.'","Je repondis avec mepris : << -- Vous avez lu cela dans Prickwerts ; quant a l'idee que l'involution fonctionne eugenetiquement, il y a longtemps qu'elle a ete exposee par Glumpe. >>",1508,aligned

"To my astonishment, as I was turning the corner, I felt a touch on the shoulder, and turning, found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman.","Je doublais le coin de la rue, quand je me sentis touche a l'epaule, et, en me retournant, je me trouvai dans l'ombre d'un enorme policeman.",1514,aligned
He told me I was wanted.,Il me dit << qu'on avait besoin de moi >>.,1515,aligned
"I struck a sort of paralytic attitude, and cried in a high German accent, Yes, I am wanted by the oppressed of the world.","Je me campai dans la plus heroique attitude que put prendre un paralytique et m'ecriai, avec un fort accent germanique : << -- En effet, on a besoin de moi : tous les opprimes de l'univers me reclament !",1516,aligned

"'You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist, Professor de Worms.'","'Mon crime, n'est-ce pas, est d'etre le grand anarchiste, le professeur de Worms.'",1522,aligned

THE MAN IN SPECTACLES,L'HOMME AUX LUNETTES,1530,aligned
"Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well, that now I can't leave off.","Mon coeur est plein de joie, mais j'ai si bien et si longtemps joue le professeur paralytique que je ne peux plus me separer de mon role.",1531,aligned
"So that when I am among friends, and have no need at all to disguise myself, I still can't help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead just as if it were my forehead.","C'est a ce point que, meme avec mes amis, je reste deguise ; je parle bas, je fais jouer les rides de ce front comme si c'etait mon front.",1532,aligned
"We are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp, very strong, and very wicked man.","Nous tenterons d'arracher son secret a un homme tres fort, tres fin et tres mechant.",1533,aligned
You and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels out of the Tower.,"Vous et moi, demain, nous tenterons quelque chose de bien plus difficile que de voler les joyaux de la Couronne dans la Tour de Londres.",1534,aligned
"I believe there is no man, except the President, of course, who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles.","Il n'y a, je crois, personne, apres le President, d'aussi formidable que ce petit homme, avec son sourire et ses lunettes.",1535,aligned
"Then he said in a low voice ""Can you play the piano?""",-- Jouez-vous du piano ?,1536,aligned
"But then that very fanaticism in the Secretary has a human pathos, and is almost a redeeming trait.","Mais le fanatisme du secretaire a je ne sais quoi de pathetique, d'humain ; c'est un trait qui le rachete.",1537,aligned
But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the Secretary's disease.,"Le petit docteur jouit d'une robuste sante, plus revoltante mille fois que l'insanite du secretaire.",1538,aligned
Don't you notice his detestable virility and vitality?,"N'avez-vous pas remarque sa virilite, sa vitalite detestable ?",1539,aligned
"""Listen to me,"" said the other, ""and remember whom we have to see tomorrow.","-- Ecoutez-moi, reprit le professeur, et rappelez-vous qui nous devons voir demain.",1540,aligned
"He has not perhaps the white-hot enthusiasm unto death, the mad martyrdom for anarchy, which marks the Secretary.",Il n'a peut-etre pas l'enthousiasme chauffe a blanc du secretaire ni sa folie du martyre.,1541,aligned
"""Thank you,"" said Syme, ""you flatter me.""","-- Merci, dit Syme, vous me flattez.",1542,aligned
"""It does,"" said Syme; ""but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried.""","-- Je les ai, en effet, dit Syme. Au fond, ce role doit vous ennuyer un peu.",1543,aligned

"I can be quite happy, you understand, but only in a paralytic sort of way.","Je puis etre tout a fait heureux, mais, comprenez-moi bien, a la maniere seulement d'un paralytique.",1545,aligned
"After a long silence, the Professor said out of the cavernous shadow of his hands ""It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter.""","Apres un long silence, le professeur, du fond de l'ombre caverneuse de ses mains, murmura : -- Il m'eut ete tout aussi agreable d'apprendre que vous savez pianoter sur une machine a ecrire.",1546,aligned
"You should hear me say, 'Buck up, old cock!' It would bring tears to your eyes.","Ah ! ~~~ si vous m'entendiez dire : << Allons ! vieux coq ! ~~~ courage ! >>, vous en auriez les larmes aux yeux.",1547,aligned
The Professor started a little and looked at him steadily.,Le professeur eut un leger haut-le-corps et le fixa.,1548,aligned
"The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart, but they come out of my mouth quite different.",Les exclamations les plus joyeuses qui me viennent du coeur se transforment d'elles-memes en passant par mes levres.,1549,aligned
"Yes, I have rather a heavy cloud in my head.","Oui, j'ai un gros nuage dans la tete...",1550,aligned
"There is a great problem to face,"" and he sank his bald brow in his two hands.","Et ce terrible probleme a resoudre ! Il serra son front chauve dans ses mains, puis, a voix basse :",1551,aligned
"""Yes,"" said Syme in simple wonder, ""I'm supposed to have a good touch.""","-- Oui, dit Syme un peu etonne : on dit meme que je n'en joue pas mal.",1552,aligned
"""You are a very clever fellow,"" he said, ""it is a pleasure to work with you.","-- Vous etes un garcon bien intelligent, dit l'acteur-professeur ; c'est plaisir de travailler avec vous.",1553,aligned
He bounces like an india-rubber ball.,Il bondit avec l'elasticite d'une balle de caoutchouc.,1554,aligned
"""We must have several word-signs,"" said Syme seriously ""words that we are likely to want, fine shades of meaning.","-- Il nous faut, dit Syme, quelques abreviations pour les mots que nous aurons souvent a employer, pour indiquer de delicates nuances...",1555,aligned
"""Do you imagine,"" asked the Professor furiously, ""that we are going to talk to Dr. Bull about grass?""","Le professeur s'emporta. -- Pensez-vous, s'ecria-t-il, que nous allons parler d'herbe au docteur Bull ?",1556,aligned
"""Lush' too,"" said Syme, shaking his head sagaciously, ""we must have 'lush' word applied to grass, don't you know?""","-- Mon mot favori est << contemporain >> ; quel est le votre ?

"""Do stop playing the goat,"" said the Professor plaintively. ""You don't know how serious this is.""","-- Cessez de plaisanter, dit le professeur. Vous ne soupconnez pas combien tout cela est serieux.",1558,aligned
"What's yours?""",(No direct equivalent in text),1559,not aligned
"But wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity, and the Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language, as it passed through the heated brain of Syme.","Mais le vin et la conversation developpaient singulierement en lui un gout naturel pour la farce, et le professeur eut bientot a lutter contre les excessifs developpements que prenait son invention en passant par le cerveau surchauffe de Syme.",1560,aligned

"Syme, if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive, we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see.","Nous voulons, Syme, avoir cette entrevue et en sortir sains et saufs. ~~~ Il faut donc que nous convenions entre nous de quelques signes auxquels cette brute ne puisse rien comprendre.",1564,aligned

"""And you think,"" said Syme, ""that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him?""","-- Et vous pensez, dit Syme, que ce monstre sans pareil s'attendrisse quand je lui jouerai du piano ?",1567,aligned
"Depend on it, Sunday was not asleep (I wonder if he ever sleeps?) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round, black head of Dr. Bull.","Croyez-moi, Dimanche ne dormait pas -- je ne sais s'il dort jamais ! -- quand il confia tout le plan de l'attentat a la tete ronde et noire du docteur Bull.",1568,aligned
"He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles, and with his hands at conjuring, and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee.","Tres rompu au jeu des charades, tres habile aux tours de passe-passe, il fut bien vite a meme de transmettre un message par un certain nombre de coups frappes sur la table ou sur son genou.",1569,aligned
"""There are several ways in which the subject could be approached,"" said Syme reflectively, ""and the word introduced without appearing forced.","-- Il y a bien des moyens d'approcher ce sujet, poursuivit Syme, pensif, et d'amener ce mot sans qu'il paraisse force.",1570,aligned
"'""Syme,"" said his friend with a stern simplicity, ""go to bed!""'","'-- Syme, lui dit son nouvel ami avec une severe simplicite, Syme, allez vous coucher !'",1571,aligned

"He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness, and found his grey-bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed.","Le lendemain matin, l'orient etait encore scelle de nuit quand il s'eveilla. ~~~ Son allie a la barbe grise se tenait debout pres de son lit.",1577,aligned
"Syme sat up in bed blinking; then slowly collected his thoughts, threw off the bed-clothes, and stood up.",Syme s'assit en se frottant les yeux. ~~~ Lentement ses esprits lui revinrent. ~~~ Il repoussa la couverture et se leva.,1578,aligned
"It seemed to him in some curious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him, and he stood up in an air of cold danger.","Il lui sembla que toute l'atmosphere de sociabilite et de securite qu'il avait respiree pendant la precedente soiree le quittait avec ses couvertures ; il trouva en se levant l'air froid et hostile, comme le danger.",1579,aligned
"Syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank, blue eyes.","Et Syme s'immobilisait lui-meme devant cette figure immobile et parcheminee, ces yeux bleus, sans expression.",1580,aligned
"Whether or no the Professor could answer, he did not.",Il ne savait pas au juste si le professeur pouvait repondre.,1581,aligned
"""Confound you, can't you answer?"" called out Syme, in a sudden anger that had something like fear underneath.",-- Que Dieu vous confonde ! Etes-vous devenu muet ? s'ecria Syme avec une colere qui cachait quelque inquietude.,1582,aligned
He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his companion; but it was the trust between two men going to the scaffold.,Il ne mettait pas en doute la loyaute de son compagnon : mais la confiance qui les unissait etait celle de deux hommes qui vont monter a l'echafaud.,1583,aligned
"""How long did it take you?""",-- Combien de temps vous a-t-il fallu ?,1584,aligned
"The Professor was silent; his eyes were wide open, and he wore a fixed but very small smile.","Le professeur restait silencieux. Il souriait finement, faiblement.",1585,aligned
"Did you learn it all on the spot?""",Avez-vous su tout de suite vous exprimer ainsi ?,1586,aligned

The Professor did not move.,Le professeur ne bougea pas.,1593,aligned
"His first thought was that the Professor had gone mad, but his second thought was more frightful.","Sa premiere pensee fut que le professeur etait devenu fou, mais sa seconde pensee fut plus terrible encore.",1594,aligned
"After all, what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend?","Que savait-il, apres tout, de cette creature etrange dont il avait accepte, sans mefiance, l'amitie ?",1595,aligned
"They took their hats and sticks in silence; but as Syme took his sword-stick, he held it hard.",Ils prirent en silence cannes et chapeaux. Syme ne put s'empecher de crisper sa main sur sa canne a epee.,1596,aligned

"What did he know, except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale?","Que savait-il, sinon qu'il avait rencontre cet homme au dejeuner des anarchistes, puis qu'il lui avait entendu conter une histoire ridicule ?",1599,aligned
"Syme watched the twinkling movements of the talking hand, and read clearly the message ""I will only talk like this.

He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside.,Il croyait entendre dans le corridor les pas furtifs des dynamiteurs accourus pour se saisir de lui.,1602,aligned
How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside Gogol!,"N'etait-il pas invraisemblable que le Conseil preside par Dimanche comptat, outre Gogol, un autre ami ?",1603,aligned
He stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence.,"Dans cet impitoyable silence, Syme tendait l'oreille.",1604,aligned
"Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor, who had turned for the last time?","Fallait-il lire dans ces yeux sans vie l'affreuse pensee d'un triple traitre, qui venait de deserter pour la troisieme fois ?",1605,aligned
Was this man's silence a sensational way of declaring war?,Le silence de cet individu signifiait-il une sensationnelle declaration de guerre ?,1606,aligned
"They paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall, and then made their way across the river, which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as Acheron.","Ils ne s'arreterent qu'un moment pour avaler quelques sandwiches et du cafe dans un bar, puis ils passerent le fleuve, qui, dans la lumiere desolee du matin, etait aussi desole que l'Acheron.",1607,aligned
"They reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river, and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps, only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters.","Ils gagnerent le grand corps de batiment qu'ils avaient vu, la veille, de l'autre cote de l'eau, et se mirent a gravir en silence les innombrables marches de pierre, s'arretant seulement de temps a autre pour echanger, sur la rampe de fer, de breves observations.",1608,aligned
At about every other flight they passed a window; each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London.,"Tous les deux paliers, une fenetre leur permettait de voir le penible lever d'une aube pale et morne sur Londres.",1609,aligned
"From each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey, troubled sea after rain.","Les innombrables toits d'ardoise etaient comme les vagues d'une mer grise, troublee apres une pluie abondante.",1610,aligned
Syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past.,"Syme songeait que ce nouvel episode ou il s'engageait etait, de tous ceux par lesquels il avait passe deja, le pire. ~~~ C'etait froid, raisonnable et terrible.",1611,aligned
"Last night, for instance, the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a dream.","La veille, le grand batiment lui etait apparu comme une tour telle qu'on en voit en reve.",1612,aligned
"As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps, he was daunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series.","Maintenant, il s'etonnait de ces marches interminables, fatigantes ; il etait comme intimide de leur succession infinie.",1613,aligned
But it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion.,"Ce n'etait pas l'horreur ardente du songe, de l'illusion, de l'exageration.",1614,aligned
"Their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic, something unthinkable, yet necessary to thought.","C'etait de l'infini abstrait, mathematique, quelque chose d'impossible a penser et d'indispensable pourtant a la pensee.",1615,aligned
Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars.,Cela rappelait les constatations stupefiantes de l'astronomie sur les distances qui separent les etoiles fixes.,1616,aligned
"Thus the two black glasses that encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull, making him look like a death's-head.",Les lunettes qui couvraient ses yeux jouaient la profondeur de cavites ouvertes dans son crane et lui donnaient l'apparence d'une tete de mort.,1617,aligned

"Yet when he was seen properly, the French fancy fell away.","Pourtant, a le regarder de plus pres, on perdait l'envie de penser a la France.",1620,aligned
"Dr. Bull was in his white shirt and black breeches only; his cropped, dark head might well have just come out of its wig; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre.","Le docteur Bull ne portait qu'une chemise blanche et un pantalon noir ; cette tete brune, rasee, n'appelait-elle pas la perruque ? ~~~ Ne venait-elle pas de la quitter ? Il eut pu etre Marat ou un Robespierre moins soigneux.",1621,aligned
There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning.,"Entre la bordure rouge et la blanche aurore elle-meme, comment se pouvait-il que le profil noir de la guillotine ne se montrat pas ?",1622,aligned
"The moment he saw the garret and Dr. Bull sitting writing at a table, he remembered what the memory was the French Revolution.","En penetrant dans la mansarde, en voyant le docteur assis a une table et en train d'ecrire, il se precisa aussitot ce souvenir.",1623,aligned
Syme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak.,"Syme etait hante d'un souvenir historique, qu'il associait a ces chambres vides et a cette aurore austere.",1624,aligned
And when they entered Dr. Bull's bare garret it was full of light.,"Et quand ils entrerent dans la mansarde du docteur, elle etait inondee de lumiere.",1625,aligned
"By the time they reached Dr. Bull's landing, a last window showed them a harsh, white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red, more like red clay than red cloud.","Au moment ou ils atteignirent la porte du docteur Bull, ils virent par une derniere fenetre l'aurore s'encadrer d'une grossiere bordure rouge, du rouge de l'argile plutot que des nuages.",1626,aligned
"He was ascending the house of reason, a thing more hideous than unreason itself.","Syme faisait l'ascension du palais de la Raison, laquelle passe en hideur la Deraison elle-meme.",1627,aligned
"The strong, white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp shadows, made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony.","La forte lumiere blanche de la matinee, venant toute du meme cote et projetant des ombres tres precises, palissait son visage et en accentuait les angles. Il semblait plus pale et plus anguleux que la veille pendant le dejeuner sur le balcon.",1628,aligned
"And, indeed, if ever Death himself sat writing at a wooden table, it might have been he.","Si jamais, en effet, la mort s'est assise a une table pour ecrire, ce dut etre ce jour-la.",1629,aligned
"He looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in, and rose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had spoken.","Il leva les yeux et accueillit les deux hommes d'un sourire assez gai, et il quitta son siege avec cette rapidite dont le professeur avait parle.",1630,aligned
"Then he added with infinite slowness, ""We have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment's delay.""","Et il ajouta tres lentement : Tout retard, d'apres les informations que nous avons recues, serait funeste.",1631,aligned
"It was with some momentary difficulty that the Professor broke silence and began, ""I'm sorry to disturb you so early, comrade,"" said he, with a careful resumption of the slow de Worms manner.","C'est avec une certaine hesitation que le professeur rompit le silence et commenca : -- Je m'excuse de vous deranger de si grand matin, camarade, dit-il en reprenant les facons lentes et prudentes de Worms.",1632,aligned
"He set chairs for both of them, and going to a peg behind the door, proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough, dark tweed; he buttoned it up neatly, and came back to sit down at his table.","Il avanca pour eux deux chaises, prit a une patere, derriere la porte, un gilet et un veston de cheviote grossiere, se boutonna correctement et s'assit a la place ou les deux visiteurs l'avaient trouve, pres de la table.",1633,aligned
The quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless.,"Ses mouvements etaient si naturels, si aises, que Syme et le professeur en furent genes.",1634,aligned
"""You have no doubt made all the arrangements for the Paris affair?""",Vous avez sans doute tout prepare pour l'affaire de Paris ?,1635,aligned
"Dr. Bull smiled again, but continued to gaze on them without speaking.",Le docteur Bull souriait toujours et ne parlait pas.,1636,aligned
"The Professor resumed, a pause before each weary word ""Please do not think me excessively abrupt; but I advise you to alter those plans, or if it is too late for that, to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him.","Le professeur reprit, s'arretant a chaque mot : -- Je vous en prie, ne vous blessez pas de notre procede. Il faut modifier les plans, ou, s'il est trop tard pour y rien changer, rejoindre tout de suite le camarade charge de l'action et le premunir contre des dangers imprevus.",1637,aligned
"Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford, if we are to act on it.","Le camarade Syme et moi, nous avons eu une aventure. Il me faudrait plus de temps pour vous l'expliquer qu'il ne nous en est laisse pour en profiter.",1638,aligned
"I will, however, relate the occurrence in detail, even at the risk of losing time, if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss.""","Je suis pret neanmoins, mais les minutes sont precieuses, a vous donner tous les details, si vous croyez qu'il vous soit essentiel de les connaitre pour resoudre le probleme qui nous occupe.",1639,aligned
"But here was daylight; here was a healthy, square-shouldered man in tweeds, not odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles, not glaring or grinning at all, but smiling steadily and not saying a word.","Mais, ici, on etait dans la lumiere du jour ; il y avait dans cette chambre un homme sain et fort, en habits du matin, un homme nullement original, si ce n'est par ses vilaines lunettes, un homme qui ne montrait pas les dents, qui ne jetait pas de regards furieux : un homme qui souriait et se taisait !",1640,aligned
Syme remembered those wild woes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood.,"Syme se rappelait ses angoisses de la veille, comme on pense a la peur qu'on eut, tout enfant, de Croquemitaine.",1641,aligned
"About the Professor's makeup and all his antics there was always something merely grotesque, like a gollywog.","Il y avait toujours, dans les fantaisies du professeur, quelque chose de grotesque, simplement, qui rassurait.",1642,aligned
"He was spinning out his sentences, making them intolerably long and lingering, in the hope of maddening the practical little Doctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand.","Il tirait ses phrases en longueur, il les faisait insupportablement filandreuses, dans l'espoir d'impatienter le petit docteur, de revolter son sens pratique et de l'amener a une explosion de rage ou se montrerait son jeu.",1643,aligned
"But the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile, and the monologue was uphill work.","Mais le petit docteur souriait toujours, et le monologue du professeur etait peine perdue.",1644,aligned
The whole had a sense of unbearable reality.,C'est cette realite qui etait insupportable.,1645,aligned
"""Yes, the thing really happened to me,"" he said hastily.","-- En effet, interrompit-il, l'aventure m'est personnelle.",1646,aligned
Syme began to feel a new sickness and despair.,"Syme s'impatientait, et a son impatience se melait un sentiment de desespoir.",1647,aligned
"Under the increasing sunlight the colours of the Doctor's complexion, the pattern of his tweeds, grew and expanded outrageously, as such things grow too important in a realistic novel.","Sous la lumiere grandissante du jour, les nuances du teint du docteur, du drap de son habit, prenaient un relief effrayant, comme il arrive que des details sans interet, dans les romans naturalistes, prennent une importance excessive.",1648,aligned
The Doctor's smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the Professor half an hour before.,"Il venait de subir, une demi-heure plus tot, avec quelque terreur, le silence cataleptique du professeur ; mais ce n'etait rien aupres du silence souriant du docteur !",1649,aligned
"""As I say,"" resumed the Professor, like a man toiling through heavy sand, ""the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the Marquis, is one which you may think it better to have narrated; but as it came in the way of Comrade Syme rather than me ""","~~~ -- Comme je viens de le dire, reprit le professeur avec l'effort d'un homme qui se fraierait un chemin dans le sable, l'aventure qui nous est arrivee et qui nous amene chez vous, pour nous informer au sujet du marquis, est de telle nature que, peut-etre, vous desirerez en connaitre les details. ~~~",1650,aligned
"His words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem; but Syme, who was watching, saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy table.","Mais, car elle est arrivee a Syme plutot qu'a moi... ~~~ Les mots se suivaient peniblement, il les prolongeait comme dans un hymne, et Syme, qui etait sur ses gardes, vit les longs doigts du professeur frapper a coups precipites sur le bord de la table.",1651,aligned
"He read the message, ""You must go on. This devil has sucked me dry!""",Voici ce qu'il lut : -- A vous ! Le demon a vide mon sac.,1652,aligned
Syme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed.,Syme monta sur la breche avec cette bravoure et cette faconde qui ne l'abandonnaient jamais au moment du danger.,1653,aligned
"But his smile was quite slight, the pose of his head polite; the only uncanny thing was his silence.","Toutefois, rien de provocant dans le sourire, rien d'impertinent dans le port de la tete. Seul son silence etait de plus en plus inquietant.",1654,aligned
"""I had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me, thanks to my hat, for a respectable person.","J'ai eu l'avantage de m'entretenir avec un detective qui, sans doute a cause de mon chapeau, me prenait pour une personne honorable.",1655,aligned
"Wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability, I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy.","Dans le dessein de conserver son estime, je l'ai emmene au Savoy, ou je l'ai grise.",1656,aligned
"""So unless you or I can get on his track ""","'De sorte que, si l'un de nous ne se met pas immediatement a la recherche du marquis...'",1657,aligned
"""Under this influence he became friendly, and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the Marquis in France.""","'Alors, il est devenu communicatif et m'a confie que la police avait bon espoir d'arreter, avant deux jours, le marquis, en France.'",1658,aligned
"""Syme immediately brought this information to me, and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it.""","'-- Syme me rapporta aussitot la nouvelle, dit-il, et nous sommes venus pour demander quel usage il convient d'en faire.'",1659,aligned
"""It seems to me unquestionably urgent that ""","'Il me semble urgent, indiscutablement, de...'",1660,aligned
"""All this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor, but quite without the smile.""","'Pendant ce temps, Syme s'etait mis a regarder le docteur fixement, aussi fixement que le docteur regardait le professeur ; mais Syme, lui, ne souriait pas.'",1661,aligned
"""The nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability, when Syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table.""","'Les nerfs des deux camarades de combat etaient tendus a se rompre. ~~~ Tout a coup, Syme avanca le buste et frappa legerement le bord de la table.'",1662,aligned
"""His message to his ally ran, ""I have an intuition.""""",'Il disait a son allie : -- J'ai une idee.',1663,aligned
"""The Professor, with scarcely a pause in his monologue, signalled back, ""Then sit on it.""""","'-- Asseyez-vous dessus, repondit le professeur sans interrompre son monologue.'",1664,aligned
"""The Professor signalled to Syme that he would resume his explanation, and he began again with the same elaborate calm.""",'Le professeur avertit Syme qu'il allait reprendre cette conversation et il reprit en effet avec un calme etudie.',1665,aligned

"""The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way, and his protected eyes were still impenetrable.""","'Le docteur souriait toujours le plus aimablement du monde, et ses yeux, proteges par ses lunettes, restaient impenetrables.'",1668,aligned
"""Syme telegraphed, ""It is quite extraordinary.""""","'-- Une idee extraordinaire, telegraphia Syme.'",1669,aligned
"The other retorted, ""You are a dead man.""","-- Vous etes un homme mort, repliqua l'autre.",1670,aligned
"The answer was, ""Go to hell!""",elle etait ainsi formulee : -- Au diable !,1671,aligned
"Resuming his symbolic taps, he signalled to his friend, ""You scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is. It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring.""","Reprenant son pianotage, il dit : -- Vous ne vous doutez pas combien mon idee est poetique. Elle a toute la delicieuse spontaneite du printemps.",1672,aligned
"As he said he had an intuition, and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty.","Comme il le disait, il avait une idee, une idee qui s'imposait a son esprit avec l'autorite d'une evidente certitude.",1673,aligned
"Syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair, and his eyes were burning feverishly.",Syme sentit le rouge lui monter jusqu'aux racines des cheveux. Ses yeux brulaient de fievre.,1674,aligned
The Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the Doctor.,Et le professeur continua son monologue.,1675,aligned
He then studied the answer on his friend's fingers.,"Puis, il etudia la reponse de son ami ;",1676,aligned
His companion disdained to reply.,Le professeur ne daigna pas accuser reception de cette communication.,1677,aligned
"The Professor was continuing his speech, but in the middle of it Syme decided to act.",Le professeur parlait toujours. ~~~ Syme decida d'agir sans plus attendre.,1678,aligned
"He leant across the table, and said in a voice that could not be neglected ""Dr. Bull!""","Il s'accouda sur la table, et, d'une voix qui reclamait l'attention : -- Docteur Bull ! dit-il.",1679,aligned
"The Doctor's sleek and smiling head did not move, but they could have sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards Syme.","Le visage souriant du docteur ne remua point, mais on eut jure que, sous ses lunettes noires, ses yeux etaient fixes sur Syme.",1680,aligned
"""Dr. Bull,"" said Syme, in a voice peculiarly precise and courteous, ""would you do me a small favour? Would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles?""","-- Docteur Bull, reprit Syme, courtoisement, mais nettement, voudriez-vous me faire un grand plaisir ? Ayez la bonte d'oter vos lunettes.",1681,aligned
"Syme, like a man who has thrown his life and fortune on the table, leaned forward with a fiery face.","Syme, pareil a un homme qui a jete sur la table sa fortune et sa vie, restait penche en avant, la figure en feu.",1682,aligned
"The Professor swung round on his seat, and stared at Syme with a sort of frozen fury of astonishment.",Le professeur se retourna sur sa chaise en decochant a Syme un regard de reproche et de colere froide.,1683,aligned
"""Perhaps I should rather say,"" said Syme on his fingers, ""that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods.""","-- Peut-etre devrais-je plutot dire, reprit Syme avec ses doigts, que mon idee a la fraicheur salubre de l'air marin qu'on respire dans les forets luisantes et humides de rosee.",1684,aligned
"""Or yet again,"" tapped Syme, ""it is positive, as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman.""","-- Ou bien encore, insista Syme, elle a cette realite positive et charmante des cheveux d'or en fusion d'une belle femme.",1685,aligned
The Doctor did not move.,Le docteur ne bougeait pas.,1686,aligned
"For a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a pin drop, split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on the Thames.","Pendant quelques secondes, il regna un silence tel qu'on eut entendu une aiguille tomber ; seul le sifflet d'un lointain steamer, sur la Tamise, l'interrompit.",1687,aligned
"Then Dr. Bull rose slowly, still smiling, and took off his spectacles.","Puis, le docteur Bull se leva lentement, sans cesser de sourire, et ota ses lunettes.",1688,aligned
"Syme sprang to his feet, stepping backwards a little, like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion.","Syme se dressa sur ses pieds, en se reculant un peu, comme un professeur de chimie qui vient de faire eclater des gaz dans une cornue.",1689,aligned
"His eyes were like stars, and for an instant he could only point without speaking.",Ses yeux etaient comme des etoiles et un instant son emotion fut si forte qu'il ne put que montrer du doigt sans parler.,1690,aligned
"The Professor had also started to his feet, forgetful of his supposed paralysis.","Le professeur lui-meme, oubliant sa pretendue paralysie, s'etait leve aussi.",1691,aligned
"He leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at Dr. Bull, as if the Doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes.","Il s'appuyait au dossier de sa chaise et contemplait le docteur Bull d'un air indecis, comme si le redoutable personnage s'etait soudain metamorphose en crapaud.",1692,aligned
And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene.,"En realite, la transformation du docteur etait stupefiante.",1693,aligned
"The two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very boyish-looking young man, with very frank and happy hazel eyes, an open expression, cockney clothes like those of a city clerk, and an unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather commonplace.","Les deux detectives voyaient, assis devant eux un tres jeune homme, presque un jeune garcon, aux yeux brun clair, heureux et franc, a la physionomie ouverte, habille d'une maniere vulgaire, comme un employe de la Cite, certainement un etre tres bon et plutot commun.",1694,aligned
"""I knew I was a poet,"" cried Syme in a sort of ecstasy.","-- Quand je le disais que je suis un poete ! ~~~ s'ecria Syme, extasie.",1695,aligned
"The smile was still there, but it might have been the first smile of a baby.","Le docteur souriait toujours, mais son sourire etait maintenant celui d'un enfant.",1696,aligned

"""But as regards the project of Dr. Bull """,'Pour ce qui est des plans du docteur Bull...',1701,aligned
"The young man called Bull, with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him, insisted on going last until they reached the street; but there his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously, and he walked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office, talking to the others over his shoulder.","'Avec la politesse qui le caracterisait, Bull avait fait passer les premiers ses compagnons dans l'escalier. ...

"""It is jolly to get some pals,"" he said. ""I've been half dead with the jumps, being quite alone. I nearly flung my arms round Gogol and embraced him, which would have been imprudent.

"""All the blue devils in blue hell,"" said Syme, ""contributed to my blue funk!

"The young man laughed delightedly. ""Wasn't it a rag?""","'-- Je suis assez reussi, n'est-ce pas ? observa Bull avec satisfaction.'",1705,aligned
"he said. ""Such a simple idea not my own. I haven't got the brains. You see, I wanted to go into the detective service, especially the anti-dynamite business. But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter. They said my very walk was respectable, and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution. They said I looked too healthy and too optimistic, and too reliable and benevolent; they called me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard. They said that if I had been a criminal, I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man, there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal. But at last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force, and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders. And there the others all talked hopelessly. One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark. A pair of smoked spectacles will do it,' he said positively. Look at him now; he looks like an angelic office boy. Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles, and children will scream at the sight of him.''","'Et que c'est simple, pourtant ! L'idee ne m'appartient pas, je n'aurais jamais trouve cela tout seul. Je vais vous dire. J'avais l'intention d'entrer au service antianarchiste. Mais il fallait me deguiser en dynamiteur, et tous les chefs juraient leurs grands dieux que je n'y parviendrais jamais. Ils disaient que mon allure, mon attitude, mes gestes, tout trahissait en moi la respectabilite ; vu de dos, je ressemblais a la Constitution anglaise ; j'avais l'air trop bien portant, trop optimiste ; j'inspirais la confiance et respirais la bienveillance. Enfin, ils ne m'epargnerent aucune injure, a Scotland Yard. Ils allerent meme jusqu'a pretendre que, si j'avais ete un malfaiteur, j'aurais pu faire fortune avec mon air d'honnete homme, mais que, puisque j'avais le malheur d'etre un honnete homme, je ne pouvais leur rendre aucun service en jouant le malfaiteur. On me presenta neanmoins au grand chef, un bonhomme qui doit porter sur ses epaules une tete solide. Devant lui, les autres firent diverses propositions. Celui-la voulait cacher mon sourire jovial sous une barbe touffue. Celui-ci pensait a me noircir la figure pour me deguiser en anarchiste negre. Mais le vieux les fit taire : << Une paire de lunettes fumees fera l'affaire, dit-il ; regardez-le en ce moment, on dirait un angelique garcon de bureau ; mettez-lui des lunettes noires et les enfants crieront de terreur a son aspect.'",1706,aligned

The Professor still feared that all was lost; but he was loyal. He pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend's.,'Le professeur fit le geste qui signifie : Tout est perdu ! ...

"Yes, I'm in the force right enough,"" and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a matter of form.","'Oui, je suis de la police, parfaitement. Et, avec negligence, comme on s'acquitte d'une pure formalite, il montra sa carte a ses visiteurs.'",1714,aligned
"Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses, the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door, that the others instinctively followed him.","'Puis, il se coiffa d'un chapeau melon, et, reprenant ses lunettes diaboliques, il se dirigea si rapidement vers la porte que les deux autres le suivirent sans prendre le temps de la reflexion.'",1715,aligned

"Dr. Bull, however, having been carefully coached by Syme upon this point of policy, insisted, with great dignity and in very bad French, that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled.","Mais le docteur Bull, qui avait recu de Syme, sur ce point, les instructions les plus formelles, insista au contraire, avec beaucoup de dignite, et en tres mauvais francais, pour que le duel continuat jusqu'a ce que l'un des deux adversaires fut hors de combat.",1916,aligned

"But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train, not only his seconds carrying the sword-case, but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket.","Pourtant outre ses deux temoins, dont l'un portait une paire d'epees, il etait accompagne de deux domestiques charges d'une malle et d'une boite qui contenait, ainsi qu'on en pouvait juger a son aspect, le dejeuner d'un voyageur.",1919,aligned
"On his right was a little wood; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line, which he was, so to speak, guarding from the Marquis, whose goal and escape it was.","A la droite de Syme, il y avait un petit bois ; a sa gauche, la longue courbe du chemin de fer, qu'il defendait, pour ainsi dire, contre le marquis puisque c'est la que le marquis devait tendre et par la qu'il devait echapper.",1920,aligned
"But, indeed, this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business.","Mais ce contraste qui l'amusait entre les fleurs d'or et les chapeaux noirs, n'etait que le symbole d'un contraste tragique entre ces douces fleurs d'or et les noirs desseins de ces hommes.",1921,aligned

Syme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight.,"Syme, a cette manifestation d'une impatience dont il savait le motif, se demanda si le train etait deja en vue. ~~~ Il se retourna.",1923,aligned
"The first was the old fear that any miracle might happen, the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen.","C'etait, dans le premier cas, l'antique peur de l'homme qui croyait a la constante possibilite du miracle ; c'etait, dans le second cas, la peur, autrement grave, de l'homme moderne, qui ne croit a la possibilite d'aucun miracle.",1924,aligned
"He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare, and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science.","Il s'en souvenait avec ordre et clarte comme d'illusions causees par un malaise nerveux. ~~~ La peur que lui avait inspiree le professeur avait ete celle des evenements tyranniques qui se succedent dans le cauchemar.

"When the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme's arm, all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed.","Au contact du fer, Syme sentit s'evanouir toutes les terreurs diverses dont il avait ete assailli pendant les jours precedents, ainsi qu'un homme qui s'eveille dans son lit oublie ses reves.",1926,aligned

"He offered one to the Marquis, who snatched it without ceremony, and another to Syme, who took it, bent it, and poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity.","Il offrit l'une au marquis de Saint-Eustache, qui s'en saisit sans ceremonie. ~~~ Syme pesa la sienne, la courba, l'etudia aussi longtemps que les convenances le permettaient.",1931,aligned
"Colonel Ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case, taking out a pair of twin swords, which took the sunlight and turned to two streaks of white fire.","Le colonel mit un genou a terre pour ouvrir le fourreau, d'ou il tira deux epees egales, dont les lames vibrerent dans la lumiere comme deux traits de feu.",1932,aligned
But there was no smoke on the horizon.,Mais il n'y avait pas de fumee a l'horizon.,1933,aligned
"Then the Colonel took out another pair of blades, and taking one himself and giving another to Dr. Bull, proceeded to place the men.","Puis, le colonel prit une seconde paire d'epees, donna l'une au docteur Bull, garda l'autre, et mit les combattants face a face.",1934,aligned
"But he saw that these fears were fancies, for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death, with its coarse and pitiless common sense.","Mais maintenant il se rendait bien compte de l'egale inanite de ces deux peurs, maintenant qu'il etait sollicite par une autre peur, impitoyablement reelle, celle-la, et controlee par le plus grossier bon sens, la peur de la mort.",1935,aligned
"He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices, and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged.","Il etait comme un homme qui a reve, toute la nuit, de gouffres et de chutes, et qui apprend en s'eveillant qu'il va etre pendu.",1936,aligned
"For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe's foreshortened blade, and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch, vibrating like two living things, he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter, and that probably his last hour had come.","Car, des qu'il eut vu la lumiere scintiller sur la lame du marquis, des qu'il eut senti le froissement de cette lame contre la sienne, il connut qu'il avait affaire a un terrible tireur et que, selon toute probabilite, sa derniere heure avait sonne.",1937,aligned
"He felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him, in the grass under his feet; he felt the love of life in all living things.","Aussitot, toute la terre autour de lui, l'herbe a ses pieds, prit une etrange valeur a ses yeux. De quel intense amour de la vie frissonnaient toutes choses !",1938,aligned
"He could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing; he could almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were springing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow flowers blood red and burning gold and blue, fulfilling the whole pageant of the spring.","Il lui semblait entendre l'herbe pousser, voir s'epanouir dans la prairie de nouvelles fleurs, des fleurs rouges, des fleurs dorees, des fleurs bleues, tout le defile des couleurs du printemps.",1939,aligned
"And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm, staring, hypnotic eyes of the Marquis, they saw the little tuft of almond tree against the sky-line.","Et, chaque fois que son regard quittait les yeux calmes et fixes, les yeux d'hypnotiseur du marquis, Syme voyait s'estomper sur l'horizon le petit buisson blanc de l'amandier.",1940,aligned
"He had the feeling that if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree, desiring nothing else in the world.","Il avait le sentiment que, si, par quelque prodige, il echappait a la mort, il consentirait a rester, desormais, pour toujours, assis devant cet amandier, sans rien desirer de plus au monde.",1941,aligned
"Syme's sword actually bent under the weight of the Marquis's body, which it had pierced.",La lame de Syme s'etait courbee en s'enfoncant.,1942,aligned
"The attack came so fast and furious, that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows.","Ses attaques se succedaient si rapides, si furieuses, que sa lame se changeait en un faisceau de fleches brillantes.",1943,aligned
"Then he turned on Syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend, and began to fight as if with twenty weapons.","puis il revint a Syme et, transfigure en demon, se mit a s'escrimer avec une telle ardeur qu'il semblait avoir a la main vingt epees.",1944,aligned
"Once his enemy's point ran along his wrist, leaving a slight streak of blood, but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored.","Un moment, la pointe du marquis effleura le poignet de Syme, y laissant une legere trace de sang. La chose ne fut pas remarquee ou bien fut jugee negligeable.",1945,aligned
Then came an interruption and a change.,"Il y eut un repos. A la reprise, le combat prit tout a coup une nouvelle allure.",1946,aligned
"Every now and then he _riposted_, and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt his point go home, but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he was mistaken.","De temps en temps, il ripostait, et, une ou deux fois, il crut sentir sa pointe s'enfoncer. Il n'y avait pourtant point de sang a son epee, non plus qu'a la chemise du marquis. Syme pensa qu'il s'etait trompe.",1947,aligned
"But while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost, the other half of his head was as clear as glass, and he was parrying his enemy's point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed himself capable.","Mais, tout en decouvrant, dans le spectacle de la vie, cette emouvante beaute dont se parent les choses qu'on va perdre, sa raison gardait une nettete, une clarte cristalline, et il parait les coups de son ennemi avec une precision mecanique dont il se serait a peine juge capable.",1948,aligned
"Twice Syme, parrying, knocked his opponent's point far out of the fighting circle; and the third time his _riposte_ was so rapid, that there was no doubt about the hit this time.","Deux fois, en parant, Syme fit voler l'arme de son adversaire hors du cercle de combat, et sa riposte fut si rapide que cette fois, il n'y avait nul doute possible.",1949,aligned
But the Marquis's morbid energy over-reached itself.,L'energie febrile du marquis depassait son but.,1950,aligned
"At the risk of losing all, the Marquis, interrupting his quiet stare, flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right.","Cessant de regarder, comme il avait fait jusqu'alors, fixement devant lui, au risque de tout perdre, le marquis tourna la tete de cote, vers la ligne du chemin de fer,",1951,aligned
Syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground.,Il etait aussi sur d'avoir transperce son adversaire qu'un jardinier peut etre sur d'avoir fiche sa pioche dans la terre.,1952,aligned
Syme had no chance to look at the railway; but also he had no need. He could guess the reason of the Marquis's sudden madness of battle the Paris train was in sight.,Impossible a Syme de regarder la ligne du chemin de fer ; mais il n'en avait pas besoin : la subite folie combative du marquis signifiait assez clairement que le train de Paris arrivait.,1953,aligned
"Yet the Marquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger, and Syme stood staring at his own sword-point like an idiot. ~~~ There was no blood on it at all.","Pourtant, le marquis recula sous le choc, sans chanceler, et Syme regarda, d'un oeil stupide, la pointe de son epee : pas la moindre trace de sang.",1954,aligned
"He fought wildly and even weakly, and he constantly looked away at the railway line, almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel.","Son jeu devenait desordonne, hasardeux et meme faiblissait. Sans cesse il regardait du cote de la voie, evidemment bien plus preoccupe par le train que par l'acier de l'adversaire.",1955,aligned
"Syme, on the other hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an intellectual fury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword.","Syme, au contraire, apportait de la methode dans sa fureur. ~~~ Il y avait de l'intelligence dans sa furie.",1956,aligned
"For this purpose, he aimed less at the Marquis's body, and more at his throat and head.",Il voulait savoir pourquoi son epee restait vierge de sang et il visait moins a la poitrine qu'a la figure et a la gorge.,1957,aligned
A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man's neck below the jaw.,"Une minute et demie apres, l'epee de Syme penetra dans le cou du marquis, sous la machoire.",1958,aligned
"There was an instant of rigid silence, and then Syme in his turn fell furiously on the other, filled with a flaming curiosity.","Il y eut un instant de silence rigide puis, a son tour, Syme se jeta furieusement sur son ennemi, et a sa fureur se melait une curiosite exasperee.",1959,aligned
"The Marquis was probably, in a general sense, a better fencer than he, as he had surmised at the beginning, but at the moment the Marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage.","Le marquis etait meilleur tireur que Syme ; mais, distrait en ce moment, il risquait de perdre ses avantages.",1960,aligned
It came out clean.,Elle en sortit intacte.,1961,aligned
"Half mad, he thrust again, and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis's cheek.","Affole, Syme fit une nouvelle attaque, et, cette fois, son epee aurait du balafrer le visage de l'adversaire ; a ce visage, pas une egratignure.",1962,aligned
"His thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train, which ended, as if proudly, in a long and piercing whistle.","Et ses pensees s'elevaient toujours plus haut, a mesure que le bruit de la machine se faisait plus distinct, plus puissant. Ce bruit cessa dans un supreme sifflement, prolonge et strident comme un cri d'orgueil.",1963,aligned
"and as the word went through his head, he heard a faint and far-off hoot, which would soon be the roar of the Paris train.","Il articulait mentalement ce mot, quand il entendit un sifflement faible et lointain : encore quelques secondes, et a ce sifflement succederait le tonnerre du train de Paris.",1964,aligned
"He fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity, like a Mohammedan panting for Paradise.","Il se remit a tirer avec une legerete, une adresse qui tenait du prodige, tel le mahometan qui soupire apres le paradis.",1965,aligned
"""Stop!"" said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience. ""I want to say something.""",-- Arretez ! dit le marquis avec une autorite irresistible. J'ai quelque chose a dire.,1966,aligned
The train stopped.,Le train s'arretait.,1967,aligned
"""After all,"" he said to himself, ""I am more than a devil; I am a man.

Je puis faire une chose que Satan lui-meme ne peut pas faire : je puis mourir.",1968,aligned
"The leap was wonderful, and not the less wonderful because Syme had plunged his sword a moment before into the man's thigh.","Son geste etait admirable, d'autant plus peut-etre que Syme venait de lui plonger son epee dans le mollet.",1969,aligned
Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation.,"Peut-etre avait-il ete choisi, comme champion de ces etres et de ces choses simples et vraies, pour croiser l'epee avec l'ennemi de la creation.",1970,aligned
"Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark.","En tout cas, il y avait cela de certain que, par trois fois, une epee l'avait atteint, vainement.",1971,aligned
"When Syme had that thought he drew himself up, and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees.","Quand il se fut formule a lui-meme cette pensee, Syme se redressa. Tout ce qu'il y avait en lui de bon exulta, dans les hauteurs de l'air, comme le vent qui chante dans la cime des arbres.",1972,aligned
"""What is the matter?"" asked Colonel Ducroix, staring.","-- Quoi donc ? demanda le colonel Ducroix, stupefait.",1973,aligned
The Professor was only a goblin; this man was a devil perhaps he was the Devil!,Le professeur n'etait qu'un lutin. Cet homme-ci etait un diable -- peut-etre le Diable !,1974,aligned
"Suddenly, to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword.","Tout a coup, au grand etonnement de tous, le marquis recula hors de la portee de l'epee de son adversaire et jeta la sienne a terre.",1975,aligned
But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy-turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him.,Cette nouvelle peur spirituelle etait quelque chose de plus epouvantable que ce monde renverse dans lequel le paralytique lui avait donne la chasse.,1976,aligned
Surely the man had a charmed life.,le marquis avait un charme.,1977,aligned
For one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with supernatural terrors.,"Pour un moment, le ciel de Syme se chargea de nouveau de noires terreurs monstrueuses :",1978,aligned
But there was no scar.,(No direct equivalent in text),1979,not aligned
"He thought of all the human things in his story of the Chinese lanterns in Saffron Park, of the girl's red hair in the garden, of the honest, beer-swilling sailors down by the dock, of his loyal companions standing by.","Il pensait a tout ce qu'il y avait d'humain dans son aventure, aux lanternes venitiennes de Saffron Park, aux cheveux blonds de la jeune fille dans le jardin, aux honnetes matelots qui buvaient de la biere pres des docks, aux loyaux compagnons qui dans cet instant meme se tenaient a ses cotes.",1980,aligned
As the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in Paris; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell.,"Comme le train se rapprochait, Syme se representait les gens, a Paris, occupes a parer les rues, a dresser des arcs de triomphe ; il prenait sa part de la gloire de la grande Republique dont il defendait la porte contre l'enfer.",1981,aligned
"""Has there been foul play?""",Y a-t-il eu quelque irregularite ?,1982,aligned

He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism, which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe.","Gabriel Syme venait de faire, dans cette foret tachetee de lumieres, une decouverte que beaucoup de peintres modernes y avaient faite avant lui : il avait trouve ce que nos modernes nomment l'impressionnisme, c'est-a-dire une des formes innombrables de ce scepticisme radical et final qui ne reconnait pas de support, de plancher a l'univers.",2129,aligned
"Everything only a glimpse, the glimpse always unforeseen, and always forgotten.","Tout ne consistait-il pas en visions rapides, ephemeres, toujours imprevues et aussitot oubliees qu'apercues ?",2130,aligned

Was there anything that was apart from what it seemed?,Existait-il quelque difference appreciable entre n'importe quoi et n'importe quoi ?,2134,aligned
The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective.,"Le marquis avait enleve son nez, et c'etait maintenant un detective.",2135,aligned
That tragic self-confidence which he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a friend.,"Cette tragique confiance en soi, qui l'avait anime quand il s'etait imagine que le marquis etait le Diable, l'abandonnait maintenant qu'il savait que le marquis etait un ami.",2136,aligned
Even the solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them.,"Syme avait peine a distinguer ses compagnons, defigures par les jeux dansants de la lumiere et de l'ombre.",2137,aligned
"Now a man's head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt, leaving all else obliterated; now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro.","Tantot le visage de l'un emergeait d'un clair-obscur a la Rembrandt, tantot deux mains d'une blancheur eblouissante, qui appartenaient a un homme a tete de negre.",2138,aligned
"The ex-Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes, and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of their pursuers.","L'ex-marquis avait ramene son chapeau de paille sur ses yeux, et l'ombre projetee du bord partageait si nettement en deux moities son visage qu'il semblait porter un masque tout pareil a celui des ennemis.",2139,aligned
He felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy.,"Et il se sentait incapable, apres tous ses etonnements, de preciser quelque difference bien nette entre un ami et un ennemi.",2140,aligned
The fancy tinted Syme's overwhelming sense of wonder.,Ce detail produisit sur Syme un effet hors de proportion avec sa cause.,2141,aligned

"With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquis's straw hat, the man whom he had come to address as Ratcliffe.","En deux bonds, il rejoignit l'homme qui portait le chapeau de paille du marquis, l'homme qu'il avait appris a appeler Ratcliff.",2143,aligned
"In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful, he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation.

"At the end of the four minutes, however, they saw that the Colonel was right, for the wood-cutter entered into their plans, not with the vague servility of a tout too-well paid, but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee.","Mais au bout de quatre minutes, ils virent que le colonel ne s'etait pas trompe.

"Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was driven quickly enough, and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those, whoever they were, who were hunting them.","Si lourd et grincant que fut le vehicule, on allait vite, et bientot les detectives constaterent avec satisfaction que la distance s'allongeait d'une maniere appreciable entre eux et leurs ennemis.",2188,aligned
"For, after all, the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved.",Mais comment les anarchistes avaient-ils pu reunir un si considerable contingent ? ~~~ La question restait sans reponse.,2189,aligned
One man's presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the Secretary.,"De fait, il avait suffi de la presence d'un seul homme pour les mettre en fuite : les detectives avaient pris la fuite en reconnaissant le monstrueux rictus du secretaire.",2190,aligned
Syme every now and then looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track.,"De temps a autre, Syme regardait par-dessus son epaule.",2191,aligned
"As the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance, he could see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it; and across these was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous beetle.","Comme la distance faisait paraitre la foret plus petite, Syme apercut les versants ensoleilles de la colline qui encadraient le petit bois, et sur les versants s'avancait le carre noir de la foule en marche, compacte : on eut dit un monstrueux scarabee.",2192,aligned
"In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes, which were almost telescopic, Syme could see this mass of men quite plainly.","Dans la pleine lumiere du soleil, Syme, grace a sa vue tres percante, presque telescopique, distinguait les individus.",2193,aligned
He could see them as separate human figures; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man.,Mais il etait de plus en plus surpris de voir qu'ils se deplacaient comme un seul homme.,2194,aligned

"but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack, as would be natural in an ordinary mob.","Mais cette foule ne se dispersait pas, ne s'eparpillait pas comme une foule ordinaire n'eut pas manque de le faire.",2196,aligned
"They moved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness, like a staring army of automatons.",L'unite du mouvement avait quelque chose d'epouvantablement mecanique ; c'etait comme une armee d'automates.,2197,aligned

But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly.,"Ce qui nous importe, c'est qu'ils disparaissent regulierement !",2204,aligned
It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse.,"Et, en effet, la tache noire des ennemis allait s'effacant de plus en plus, a mesure que le paysan frappait son cheval.",2205,aligned
"The level of the sunlit landscape, though flat as a whole, fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea, in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the Sussex downs.","Le niveau du sol, assez egal en somme, s'etageait, de l'autre cote du bois, vers la mer, en vagues lourdes, dont la premiere moitie etait assez escarpee. ~~~ Cela rappelait les vagues de terrain des dunes du Sussex.",2206,aligned
"The only difference was that in Sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a little brook, but here the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfall.","Une seule difference : dans le Sussex, la route eut ete brisee et anguleuse comme le lit d'un petit ruisseau, tandis que la blanche route francaise se dessinait, devant les fugitifs, droite comme une cataracte.",2207,aligned
"Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle, and in a few minutes, the road growing yet steeper, they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a great blue arc of the sea.","La voiture descendit cette pente abrupte, et, la route devenant de plus en plus raide, ils apercurent a leurs pieds le petit port de Lancy et un grand arc de mer bleue.",2208,aligned
The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon.,Le nuage ambulant de leurs ennemis avait tout a fait disparu de l'horizon.,2209,aligned
"The horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms, and the horse's nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little caf of ""Le Soleil d'Or.""","La voiture contourna un bouquet d'ormeaux, et le mufle du cheval faillit frapper a la tete un vieillard assis sur un banc, devant un petit cafe a l'enseigne du Soleil d'Or.",2210,aligned
"The peasant grunted an apology, and got down from his seat.",Le paysan murmura une excuse et descendit de son siege.,2211,aligned
"The others also descended one by one, and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy, for it was quite evident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern.","Les detectives descendirent a leur tour, l'un apres l'autre, et adresserent au vieillard quelques phrases de politesse. ~~~ A ses manieres accueillantes, on devinait en lui le proprietaire de l'auberge.",2212,aligned

"Everything about him, his pipe, his pot of beer, his flowers, and his beehive, suggested an ancestral peace;","Tout, autour de lui, sa pipe, son pot de biere, ses fleurs, sa ruche, respirait une paix immemoriale.",2215,aligned

"By this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward, and by its rays Syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller, but still standing and looking after them quite silently, the sunshine in his silver hair.","Le soleil descendait vers l'occident et a sa lueur Syme vit diminuer de plus en plus la haute stature de l'aubergiste qui les suivait du regard, immobile sur le seuil.",2238,aligned
"The two servants, who had carried the Marquis's luggage when he was a marquis, were left behind to drink at the caf by common consent, and not at all against their own inclination.","Les deux domestiques qui avaient porte le bagage du marquis, quand il etait encore marquis, resterent a l'auberge, ou ils purent boire selon leur inclination.",2239,aligned
"By Ducroix's advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and wine, and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available, they clattered away down the steep, white road.","Sur le conseil de Ducroix, on se munit de quelques provisions de bouche et de vin.

"When that gentleman opened it, not without impatience, he found it contained the words: ""Fly at once. The truth about your trouser-stretchers is known.

"The three cabmen, who had been stunned for a moment, whipped up their horses and slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing prey.","Les trois cochers, un moment abasourdis, fouetterent leurs chevaux, et peu a peu la distance diminua qui separait les chasseurs de leur proie.",2636,aligned
"Sunday leant forward, seized it, and jerked it violently out of the man's hand.",(No direct equivalent in text),2637,not aligned
"He opened the trap to talk reasonably to his fare, and in so doing let the long whip droop over the front of the cab.","Mais celui-ci s'empara du fouet, que le cocher, en se penchant en arriere, laissait pendre sur le devant du cab, et l'on vit Dimanche se dresser et fouetter les chevaux en poussant des cris qui les effrayerent, si bien que le cab se mit a filer a une vitesse folle, de rue en rue.",2638,aligned
"He and Bull sprang into the cab together, the Professor and the Inspector into another, while the Secretary and the late Gogol scrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying Syme, who was pursuing the flying President.","Bull le rejoignit juste a temps pour sauter avec lui dans la voiture. Wilks et Ratcliff en prirent une autre ; le secretaire et Gogol, une troisieme.",2639,aligned
"At the highest ecstacy of speed, Sunday turned round on the splashboard where he stood, and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab, with white hair whistling in the wind, he made a horrible face at his pursuers, like some colossal urchin.","Au moment le plus vertigineux de cette vertigineuse course, Dimanche se retourna. Debout sur le marchepied, la tete hors du cab, ses cheveux blancs eparpilles au vent, il fit a ses anciens conseillers une epouvantable grimace, la grimace de quelque gamin colossal.",2640,aligned
"Then raising his right hand swiftly, he flung a ball of paper in Syme's face and vanished.","Puis, levant la main, il jeta a la figure de Syme une boulette de papier et disparut.",2641,aligned
"Syme caught the thing while instinctively warding it off, and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers.","Syme, ayant eu un mouvement instinctif pour eviter de recevoir la boulette dans la figure, la recut dans ses mains. Elle se composait de deux petites feuilles froissees et roulees entre les doigts ; sur l'une Syme lut son propre nom, et sur l'autre le nom du docteur Bull, suivi de titres ironiquement honorifiques.",2642,aligned
"One was addressed to himself, and the other to Dr. Bull, with a very long, and it is to be feared partly ironical, string of letters after his name.",(No direct equivalent in text),2643,not aligned
"Dr. Bull's address was, at any rate, considerably longer than his communication, for the communication consisted entirely of the words: ""What about Martin Tupper _now?_""","L'adresse du docteur, en tout cas, etait beaucoup plus longue que la missive elle-meme, qui se bornait a ceci : << Qu'advient-il de Martin Tupper, maintenant ? >>",2644,aligned
"""What does the old maniac mean?"" asked Bull, staring at the words. ""What does yours say, Syme?""","-- Que veut dire ce vieil original ? demanda Bull et que vous dit-il, a vous, Syme ?",2645,aligned
"Syme's message was, at any rate, longer, and ran as follows: ""No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I.",La lettre adressee a Syme etait plus longue : << Personne plus que moi ne regretterait l'intervention de l'archidiacre.,2646,aligned
"I trust it will not come to that. But, for the last time, where are your goloshes? The thing is too bad, especially after what uncle said.""","J'espere que les choses n'en arriveront pas la.

"The President's cabman seemed to be regaining some control over his horse, and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round into the Edgware Road.","Le cocher du President semblait recouvrer quelque empire sur ses chevaux ; leur allure se moderait, et, dans Edgware Road, les detectives gagnaient de l'avance, quand se produisit une circonstance qui, d'abord, leur parut providentielle.",2648,aligned
And here there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage.,(No direct equivalent in text),2649,not aligned
"But quick as it went by, Sunday had bounded out of his cab, sprung at the fire-engine, caught it, slung himself on to it, and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures.","Mais, d'un bond, Dimanche s'enleva du cab et sauta sur la pompe, qui l'emporta : dans le lointain tumultueux, on le vit qui discutait avec les pompiers etonnes, en prodiguant les gestes explicatifs.",2650,aligned
"Through street after street and square after square went whirling this preposterous vehicle, in which the fare was urging the horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it.",(No direct equivalent in text),2651,not aligned
"The President acknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the car, bowing repeatedly, kissing his hand, and finally flinging a neatly-folded note into the bosom of Inspector Ratcliffe.","Le President, pour manifester combien il etait sensible a tant d'empressement, parut a l'arriere de la pompe a incendie, salua les detectives a plusieurs reprises et leur envoya des baise-mains. Finalement, il jeta dans le sein de l'inspecteur Ratcliff un petit papier soigneusement plie.",2652,aligned
"The six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and livid in the light of his last assertion; but when he disappeared into the cab, Syme's practical senses returned to him, and leaping over the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs, he called another cab.","Les six detectives restaient la, livides, comme frappes de la foudre a la suite de cette revelation. Mais, le premier, Syme reprit ses sens et son esprit pratique. Au risque de se briser bras et jambes, il bondit du haut du balcon et, a son tour, appela un cab.",2653,aligned
"Traffic of every kind was swerving to right or left or stopping, for down the long road was coming the unmistakable roar announcing the fire-engine, which in a few seconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt.","La circulation fut interrompue, a cause d'une pompe a incendie qu'on entendait mugir et qui bientot fut la, dans un bruit de tonnerre.",2654,aligned

"Yet before he dropped he pulled himself up again as on a horizontal bar, and thrusting his great chin over the edge of the balcony, said solemnly ""There's one thing I'll tell you though about who I am.","Mais, avant de se laisser choir dans le vide, il se redressa a la force des poignets, et, dressant son menton au niveau de la balustrade, il dit, avec solennite : -- Il est une chose, pourtant, que je veux vous apprendre : c'est moi qui etais dans la chambre obscure, c'est moi qui vous ai fait entrer dans la police.",2656,aligned
"Before one of them could move, the monstrous man had swung himself like some huge ourang-outang over the balustrade of the balcony.","Avant qu'aucun d'eux eut fait un geste, le monstrueux personnage, comme un orang-outang gigantesque, avait enjambe la balustrade du balcon.",2657,aligned

"He held up his hand, and there came out of the thicket a long growling roar that seemed to get under the skin and freeze the flesh a low thrilling roar that made a throbbing in the air all about them.","Il eleva la main pour commander le silence.

There was no doubt about it this time.,"Pas de doute possible, en effet.",2695,aligned
"Clean across the space of grass, about two hundred yards away, with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his heels, went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride, with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship's bowsprit, and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom.","A deux cents pas de la, a travers la pelouse, toute une foule bruyante et gesticulante a ses talons, un enorme elephant gris passait a grandes enjambees, le corps aussi rigide que la carene d'un vaisseau, et barrissant comme la trompette du Jugement.",2696,aligned
"On the back of the bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all the placidity of a sultan, but goading the animal to a furious speed with some sharp object in his hand.","Sur le dos de l'animal, le President Dimanche siegeait, plus calme que le sultan sur son trone. ~~~ Au moyen de quelque objet tranchant, il aiguillonnait sa monture, et la poussait methodiquement a une furieuse allure.",2697,aligned

"As they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished, Syme felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed.","Tout en se precipitant vers la grille que l'elephant venait de franchir, Syme eut une vision eblouie des singuliers animaux prisonniers dans les cages.",2704,aligned
Afterwards he thought it queer that he should have seen them so clearly.,"Plus tard, il s'etonna d'avoir pu les distinguer si nettement.",2705,aligned

"Just before they came to Baker Street, however, he was seen to throw something far up into the air, as a boy does a ball meaning to catch it again.","Mais, juste avant d'atteindre Baker Street, il jeta quelque chose en l'air, avec le geste d'un enfant qui lance un ballon pour le rattraper.",2713,aligned
"This time Sunday did not turn round, but offered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back, which maddened them, if possible, more than his previous mockeries.","Cette fois, Dimanche ne se retourna pas.

The six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed the elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the streets.,Les six malheureux detectives se jeterent dans des cabs et se lancerent a la poursuite de l'elephant.

"Through street after street, through district after district, went the prodigy of the flying elephant, calling crowds to every window, and driving the traffic left and right.","Rue apres rue, quartier apres quartier, furent ainsi traverses par ce prodigieux elephant de course.

"And still through all this insane publicity the three cabs toiled after it, until they came to be regarded as part of a procession, and perhaps the advertisement of a circus.","Comme les trois cabs se maintenaient avec exactitude dans le sillage de l'elephant, les badauds finirent par croire a quelque cortege : une reclame, peut-etre, pour un cirque.",2721,aligned
"The man once known as Gogol said nothing, but the movements of his hands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed efforts.","Celui qu'on avait nomme Gogol ne dit rien, mais les trepignements de ses mains et de ses pieds suggeraient l'image d'un cavalier qui presse sa monture.",2722,aligned
"They went at such a rate that distances were shortened beyond belief, and Syme saw the Albert Hall in Kensington when he thought that he was still in Paddington.","Et ce cortege devorait l'espace avec une vitesse qui passe toute imagination. ~~~ Syme apercut l'Albert Hall de Kensington, alors qu'il se croyait encore a Paddington.",2723,aligned

"As the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare, they saw the white road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages, such a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house in Park Lane.","Sur cette route, les six voyageurs virent une file de voitures, comme il y en a aux abords d'un hotel de Park Lane.",2942,aligned
"Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of splendid servants, all dressed in the grey-blue uniform, and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman, but rather to the officials and ambassadors of a great king.","Aupres de ces equipages se tenaient des valets vetus de la livree gris-bleu. ~~~ Ils avaient tous ce maintien fier et solennel, tres rare chez les serviteurs d'un simple particulier, et qui caracterise plutot les officiers et ambassadeurs d'un grand roi.",2943,aligned

They had all become inured to things going roughly; but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them.,Ils etaient habitues aux catastrophes ; ils furent stupefaits de l'heureuse tournure que prenaient les choses.,2951,aligned
"They could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages, and carriages with cushions.","Ils ne pouvaient pas se faire la moindre idee de ce qu'etaient ces voitures, ils se contenterent de savoir que c'etaient des voitures, et des voitures capitonnees.",2952,aligned
Very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him.,"Vaguement, insensiblement presque, il s'apercut toutefois que la route etait belle, que la voiture franchissait la porte de pierre d'une sorte de parc, puis gravissait une colline, boisee a gauche a droite, mais soigneusement cultivee.",2953,aligned

"It was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done,","Tant que l'initiative avait ete possible, il avait tenu haut son menton barbu.",2955,aligned
Syme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment.,"Syme s'abandonnait au destin. Tandis que les roues tournaient, il regardait passer l'ombre fuyante des arbres.",2956,aligned
They could not conceive who the old man was who had led them; but it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages.,Ils ne savaient pas du tout qui etait le vieillard qui les avait conduits ; ils se contenterent de savoir qu'il les avait conduits jusqu'a ces voitures.,2957,aligned
"He saw that they passed the stone gates of what might have been a park, that they began gradually to climb a hill which, while wooded on both sides, was somewhat more orderly than a forest.",(No direct equivalent in text),2958,not aligned
"Then there began to grow upon him, as upon a man slowly waking from a healthy sleep, a pleasure in everything.","Peu a peu, comme s'il sortait d'un sommeil bienfaisant, il se mit a prendre a toutes choses un singulier plaisir.",2959,aligned
"He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be, living walls; that a hedge is like a human army, disciplined, but all the more alive.","Il y avait des buissons, et il s'apercut qu'ils etaient ce que doivent etre des buissons, des murailles vivantes ; car un buisson est comme une armee humaine, d'autant plus vivante qu'elle est plus disciplinee.",2960,aligned
"He saw high elms behind the hedges, and vaguely thought how happy boys would be climbing there.","Il y avait de grands ormeaux, au-dela des buissons, et Syme songea au plaisir des enfants qui pouvaient y grimper.",2961,aligned
"Then his carriage took a turn of the path, and he saw suddenly and quietly, like a long, low, sunset cloud, a long, low house, mellow in the mild light of sunset.","Puis, la voiture decrivit une courbe, sans effort, sans hate, et il vit une longue maison basse, tel un long et bas nuage du soir, baignee de la douce lumiere du couchant.",2962,aligned
"It was either this elm-top or that crooked path, it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window; but each man of them declared that he could remember this place before he could remember his mother.","Cela tenait au sommet de cet ormeau, ou a ce tournant du chemin, a ce bout de jardin pour l'un, et pour l'autre a la forme de cette fenetre ; mais chacun d'eux declara qu'il se rappelait plus aisement cet endroit que les traits de sa mere.",2963,aligned
All the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood.,"Dans la suite, les six amis purent echanger leurs impressions. ~~~ Ils ne furent pas d'accord sur les details, mais tous convinrent que ce lieu leur avait, pour une raison ou pour une autre, rappele leur enfance.",2964,aligned
"When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large, low, cavernous gateway, another man in the same uniform, but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat, came out to meet them.","Les equipages etaient parvenus a une porte large, basse, voutee. ~~~ Un homme portant la livree des domestiques, mais avec une etoile d'argent sur la poitrine de son habit gris, vint les accueillir.",2965,aligned

"Exactly at the same moment a man in blue, who had been appointed as his valet, said very solemnly ""I have put out your clothes, sir.""","En cet instant meme, un valet habille de bleu, attache a sa personne, entra et lui dit avec solennite : -- J'ai prepare les habits de Monsieur.",2971,aligned
"At once the whole enigma sprang up, simply as the question of how he had got there, and how he was to get out again.",Il se demanda alors comment il etait arrive dans ce chateau et comment il en sortirait.,2972,aligned
"and there he saw the frightful figure that he was blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him, his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass, his clothes torn into long, wavering tatters.","Mais il vit dans ce miroir un visage effrayant, tout saignant des ecorchures que lui avaient faites les branches des arbres, avec ses cheveux blonds herisses pareils a de l'herbe fletrie, et ses vetements dechires flottaient en longues banderoles.",2973,aligned
"He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class, to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair;","Il s'approcha tout de suite d'un grand miroir, avec l'instinct des gens de sa classe, dans le dessein de rectifier le noeud de sa cravate ou de remettre de l'ordre dans sa chevelure.",2974,aligned

"Meanwhile, sir, there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant, which he hopes you will not refuse, as it is some hours before supper.""","En attendant, il y a la du faisan froid et une bouteille de bourgogne que Monsieur voudra bien accepter, car le souper n'aura lieu que dans quelques heures.",2977,aligned
"""Cold pheasant is a good thing,"" said Syme reflectively, ""and Burgundy is a spanking good thing.","-- Le faisan froid, dit Syme songeur, est une bonne chose, le bourgogne est une chose excellente.",2978,aligned
"The servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blue drapery, rather of the nature of a domino, on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden sun, and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents.","Le valet prit sur une ottomane une longue draperie bleu paon, assez semblable a un domino ; sur le devant brillait un grand soleil d'or, et de-ci de-la etaient semes des etoiles et des croissants.",2979,aligned
"But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means, and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me.","Mais, vraiment, je suis beaucoup moins presse de manger et de boire que de savoir ce que signifie tout ceci et de voir le costume qui m'est destine.",2980,aligned

The man had never looked so noble.,Jamais cet homme n'avait eu si noble mine.,3005,aligned
"He was draped in a long robe of starless black, down the centre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white, like a single shaft of light.","Il etait drape dans une ample robe d'un noir absolu, comme une nuit sans etoiles, traversee d'une large bande d'un blanc pur, comme d'un unique rayon de lumiere.",3006,aligned
The whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment.,Ce deguisement avait un caractere de grande severite monacale.,3007,aligned
There was no need for Syme to search his memory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness.,"Syme n'eut pas a faire un trop penible effort de memoire ni a consulter la Bible pour se rappeler que le premier des six jours est celui de la creation de la lumiere, separee des tenebres : symbole que ce vetement imposait a la pensee.",3008,aligned
"There was a dancing lamp-post, a dancing apple tree, a dancing ship.","Il y avait un reverbere qui dansait, un pommier qui dansait, un bateau qui dansait.",3009,aligned
"If Syme had been able to see himself, he would have realised that he, too, seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else.","Mais s'il avait pu lui-meme se voir, Syme aurait constate que, pour la premiere fois, il se ressemblait, vraiment, a lui-meme et a nul autre.",3010,aligned
"Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings, this man's eyes were still stern.","Syme ne s'etonna pas que, meme dans ce lieu d'abondance et de plaisance, les regards de cet homme fussent restes severes.",3011,aligned
"The vestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol; and Syme felt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black expressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary, with his inhuman veracity and his cold frenzy, which made him so easily make war on the anarchists, and yet so easily pass for one of them.","Et Syme admira combien ce simple vetement blanc et noir exprimait avec exactitude l'ame du pale et austere secretaire. Cet amour inhumain de la verite, cette sombre frenesie qui l'animait contre les anarchistes et qui l'eut fait passer pour un anarchiste lui-meme !",3012,aligned
"There were a thousand other such objects, however.",Mais combien d'autres objets s'animaient dans ce jardin !,3013,aligned
"Syme even saw, with a queer thrill, one dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill, with a beak twice as big as himself the queer bird which had fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long road at the Zoological Gardens.","Syme decouvrit meme avec un curieux frisson, un danseur deguise en oiseau, avec un bec deux fois aussi grand que son corps, et il se souvint de l'oiseau bizarre, de ce probleme vivant qui avait occupe son imagination, tandis qu'il courait le long de l'avenue du Jardin zoologique.",3014,aligned
"There was a man dressed as a windmill with enormous sails, a man dressed as an elephant, a man dressed as a balloon; the two last, together, seemed to keep the thread of their farcical adventures.","Il y avait un homme habille en moulin a vent, avec d'enormes ailes, un autre en elephant, un autre en ballon, allusions ceux-ci a des episodes recents.",3015,aligned
No smell of ale or orchards could make the Secretary cease to ask a reasonable question.,Il n'etait pas de biere ni de jardin dont le parfum put empecher le secretaire de poser une question raisonnable.,3016,aligned
by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress.,"La, dans cette lumiere brisee et multiple, evoluaient d'innombrables danseurs aux costumes bigarres, d'une fantaisie folle qui semblait chercher a reproduire toutes les formes de la nature.",3017,aligned
Syme seemed to see every shape in Nature imitated in some crazy costume.,(No direct equivalent in text),3018,not aligned
"and his square, sensible face, with its not unfriendly cynicism, seemed appropriate enough to it.","Son visage carre, intelligent, ou se revelait un aimable cynisme, convenait a ce role.",3019,aligned
"For he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made,","C'est que Ratcliff etait l'homme du troisieme jour, celui qui vit la creation de la terre et de toutes les choses vertes.",3020,aligned
"who was clad in spring green like a huntsman, and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees.","Il etait vetu tel un chasseur d'un habit vert printanier, illustre d'arbres qui entrelacaient leurs branches.",3021,aligned
"As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook Ratcliffe,","En descendant ensemble le grand escalier, ils rencontrerent Ratcliff.",3022,aligned
"For him the great moment is not the creation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon.","Le grand jour, pour lui, ce n'est pas celui ou naquit la lumiere : c'est le jour ou brillerent le soleil et la lune.",3023,aligned
The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite; the poet always loves the finite.,Le philosophe peut s'eprendre de l'infini ; le poete aimera toujours le fini.,3024,aligned
"They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden, full of torches and bonfires,","Un autre couloir, bas de plafond et large, les mena dans un grand jardin anglais, tout illumine de torches et de feux de joie.",3025,aligned
"For if the Secretary stood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light, Syme was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes, to split it up into sun and star.","Le secretaire representait le philosophe epris de la lumiere en soi, originelle et sans forme. En Syme, il fallait reconnaitre le poete, qui cherche a donner une forme a la lumiere, a en faire des etoiles et des soleils.",3026,aligned
One would have thought that the untamable tune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field and street dancing an eternal jig.,C'etait comme si la melodie endiablee de quelque musicien fou eut entraine dans une gigue interminable tous les objets qu'on rencontre a travers les champs et les rues.,3027,aligned
"And long afterwards, when Syme was middle-aged and at rest, he could never see one of those particular objects a lamppost, or an apple tree, or a windmill without thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel of masquerade.","-- Bien plus tard, alors qu'il eut depasse la maturite et quand il vecut dans la retraite, Syme ne pouvait voir un reverbere, un pommier, un moulin a vent, sans se demander si ce n'etaient pas la quelques temoins attardes de cette folle mascarade.",3028,aligned
"On one side of this lawn, alive with dancers, was a sort of green bank, like the terrace in such old-fashioned gardens.","La pelouse etait limitee, d'un seul cote, par un remblai de verdure, une sorte de terrasse comme on en trouve souvent dans ces parcs de style ancien.",3029,aligned
"Gogol, or Tuesday, had his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the division of the waters, a dress that separated upon his forehead and fell to his feet, grey and silver, like a sheet of rain.","La simplicite de Gogol-Mardi etait heureusement exprimee par un costume ou avait ete dessinee la division des eaux : la separation commencait au front et s'achevait aux pieds, en plis gris et argent, telle une ondee de pluie.",3030,aligned
Gogol and Dr. Bull were already in their seats; the Professor was just mounting to his.,Gogol et Bull occupaient deja les leurs ; le professeur prenait place.,3031,aligned
"Along this, in a kind of crescent, stood seven great chairs, the thrones of the seven days.","La, sept sieges avaient ete disposes en croissant : les trones des sept jours.",3032,aligned
"The Professor, whose day was that on which the birds and fishes the ruder forms of life were created, had a dress of dim purple, over which sprawled goggle-eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds, the union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt.","Le professeur, qui portait le nom du jour ou furent crees les oiseaux et les poissons, formes elementaires de la vie, portait un costume violet-pourpre : les poissons aux yeux fixes et les etranges oiseaux qu'on y voyait foisonner signifiaient ce melange d'insondable fantaisie et de scepticisme qui le caracterisait.",3033,aligned
"He lay back in his chair with a broad smile, the picture of an optimist in his element.","Il se carrait dans son siege, le visage epanoui d'un large sourire : c'etait l'image de l'Optimiste, dans son element.",3034,aligned
"Dr. Bull, the last day of Creation, wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in red and gold, and on his crest a man rampant.","Le vetement du docteur Bull, dernier jour de la Semaine, etait couvert de betes heraldiques, rouge et or, et au sommet de sa tete il y avait l'image d'un homme rampant.",3035,aligned
"As each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose from the carnival, such as that with which crowds receive kings.","les danseurs leur faisaient une royale ovation ; les coupes s'entre-choquaient, on brandissait des torches, des chapeaux a plumes volaient dans l'air.",3036,aligned
One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats.,"L'un apres l'autre, les pelerins gravirent le remblai et, comme ils s'asseyaient dans leurs etranges sieges, ils furent salues par un tonnerre d'applaudissements :",3037,aligned
The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels.,"Les hommes a qui ces trones etaient reserves, etaient des hommes couronnes d'exceptionnels lauriers.",3038,aligned
But the central chair was empty.,Mais le trone central restait vide.,3039,aligned
Syme was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right.,Syme etait assis a la gauche de ce trone et le secretaire a droite.,3040,aligned
"The Secretary looked across the empty throne at Syme, and said, compressing his lips ""We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field.""","Le secretaire se tourna vers Syme en regardant la place vide et lui dit, en pincant les levres : -- Nous ne savons pas encore s'il n'est pas mort dans la campagne.",3041,aligned
"But Sunday had only passed silently along the front like a shadow, and had sat in the central seat.","C'etait simplement Dimanche qui avait passe en silence, comme une ombre, et pris possession du trone central.",3042,aligned
"Almost as Syme heard the words, he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration, as if heaven had opened behind his head.","Il se taisait a peine, que Syme apercut, sur la mer de visages humains qu'il avait devant lui, une alteration a la fois effrayante et tres belle : c'etait comme si, derriere lui, les cieux s'etaient ouverts.",3043,aligned
"He was draped plainly, in a pure and terrible white, and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead.",Il etait simplement drape d'un blanc pur et terrible et ses cheveux faisaient sur son front des flammes d'argent.,3044,aligned
For a long time it seemed for hours that huge masquerade of mankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and exultant music.,"Longtemps -- des heures -- le grand ballet de l'humanite defila et dansa devant eux, aux sons d'une musique entrainante et joyeuse.",3045,aligned
"Every couple dancing seemed a separate romance; it might be a fairy dancing with a pillar-box, or a peasant girl dancing with the moon; but in each case it was, somehow, as absurd as Alice in Wonderland, yet as grave and kind as a love story.","Chaque couple de danseurs avait comme la signification d'un conte. ~~~ C'etait une fee qui dansait avec une boite aux lettres, une jeune paysanne avec la lune... Et c'etait a la fois absurde comme le conte d'Alice au Pays des merveilles, et grave et touchant comme une histoire d'amour.",3046,aligned
"At last, however, the thick crowd began to thin itself.",Peu a peu la foule se dispersa.,3047,aligned
"Couples strolled away into the garden-walks, or began to drift towards that end of the building where stood smoking, in huge pots like fish-kettles, some hot and scented mixtures of old ale or wine.","Les couples se perdirent dans les allees du jardin ou se dirigerent vers les communs, ou l'on voyait fumer de grandes cuves pleines d'un melange bouillant et parfume de vin vieux et de biere venerable.",3048,aligned
"Above all these, upon a sort of black framework on the roof of the house, roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire, which lit up the land for miles.","Sur le toit de la maison, isole par une estrade en fer, un gigantesque feu de joie grondait dans un pot a feu, illuminant la campagne a plusieurs milles a la ronde.",3049,aligned
"It flung the homely effect of firelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown, and it seemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night.","Sur les vastes forets brunes et grises, il jetait les reflets attendris du foyer domestique et semblait porter de la chaleur jusque dans les regions desertes de la nuit superieure.",3050,aligned
"Yet this also, after a time, was allowed to grow fainter; the dim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons, or passed, laughing and clattering, into the inner passages of that ancient house.","Mais ce feu de joie aussi peu a peu s'eteignit ; les couples vagues se presserent de plus en plus etroitement autour des grands chaudrons ou, riant et causant, disparurent dans les passages de cette antique demeure.",3051,aligned
"Then Sunday spoke, but so dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation rather than beginning one.","Puis Dimanche parla. Mais d'un ton si reveur qu'on eut dit qu'il continuait une conversation interrompue, plutot qu'il n'en commencait une.",3052,aligned
"They seemed in no haste to do so, but heard in silence the hum of insects and the distant song of one bird.","Ils ne semblaient pas presses de parler, se complaisant dans ce silence, ecoutant le bruissement des insectes et le chant lointain d'un oiseau.",3053,aligned
Not one of them had spoken a word.,Aucun d'eux n'avait profere une parole.,3054,aligned
"And the seven strange men were left alone, like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone.","Les sept hommes etaient seuls, comme des statues de pierre, sur leurs sieges de pierre.",3055,aligned
Finally the last stray merry-maker ran into the house whooping to his companions.,"Enfin, le dernier danseur disparut en courant dans le chateau et en criant a ses compagnons de l'attendre.",3056,aligned
Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the garden; soon only four.,"Bientot il n'y eut plus qu'une dizaine de promeneurs dans le jardin, puis il n'en resta que quatre.",3057,aligned
"The fire faded, and the slow, strong stars came out.","Le feu s'eteignit et au ciel, les lentes etoiles brillaient, imperieusement.",3058,aligned
"""We will eat and drink later,"" he said.","-- Nous irons manger et boire plus tard, dit-il.",3059,aligned
"""Let us remain together a little, we who have loved each other so sadly, and have fought so long.","Restons ensemble quelque temps, nous qui nous sommes si douloureusement aimes, si opiniatrement combattus.",3060,aligned
"The sun in heaven denied it, the earth and sky denied it, all human wisdom denied it.","Le soleil dans le ciel la dementait, le ciel meme et la terre, la sagesse humaine, tout dementait cette voix.",3061,aligned
"I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war, in which you were always heroes epic on epic, iliad on iliad, and you always brothers in arms.","Je crois me rappeler des siecles de guerres heroiques, dont vous avez toujours ete les heros, epopee sur epopee, Iliade sur Iliade ou vous futes toujours compagnons d'armes !",3062,aligned
"Whether it was but recently (for time is nothing), or at the beginning of the world, I sent you out to war.","Que ces evenements soient recents ou qu'ils datent de l'origine du monde, peu importe, car le temps n'est qu'illusion. Je vous ai envoyes dans la bataille.",3063,aligned
"You heard the voice in the dark, and you never heard it again.","Vous entendiez cette voix dans les tenebres, puis, vous ne l'entendiez jamais plus.",3064,aligned
And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself.,"Et moi-meme, je la dementais, quand je vous apparaissais a la lumiere du jour.",3065,aligned
"I sat in the darkness, where there is not any created thing, and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue.","Je restais dans les tenebres, ou il n'est rien de cree, et je n'etais pour vous qu'une voix qui vous commandait le courage et une vertu surnaturelle.",3066,aligned
"""But you were men.",-- Mais vous etiez des hommes.,3067,aligned
"You did not forget your secret honour, though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you.","Vous avez garde le secret de votre honneur, bien que la creation tout entiere se transformat en instrument de torture pour vous l'arracher.",3068,aligned
"Syme stirred sharply in his seat, but otherwise there was silence, and the incomprehensible went on.",Syme eut un brusque mouvement. Mais le silence ne fut pas rompu et l'incomprehensible poursuivit :,3069,aligned

"There was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the black-browed Secretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards Sunday, and said in a harsh voice ""Who and what are you?""","Il regnait un absolu silence dans le jardin illumine d'etoiles, et le secretaire se tourna implacable, les sourcils fronces, vers Dimanche, et l'interrogea d'une voix rauque : -- Qui etes-vous ? qui etes-vous ?",3072,aligned
"""I am the Sabbath,"" said the other without moving. ""I am the peace of God.""","-- Je suis le Sabbath, repondit l'autre sans bouger : je suis la paix du Seigneur.",3073,aligned
"The Secretary started up, and stood crushing his costly robe in his hand.","Le secretaire bondit sur ses pieds, froissant dans ses mains le drap precieux de son vetement :",3074,aligned
"""I know what you mean,"" he cried, ""and it is exactly that that I cannot forgive you. I know you are contentment, optimism, what do they call the thing, an ultimate reconciliation.","-- Je comprends ce que vous voulez dire, cria-t-il, et c'est la precisement ce que je ne puis vous pardonner ! Je sais que vous etes la satisfaction, l'optimisme et -- comment dit-on encore ? -- la reconciliation finale.",3075,aligned
"Well, I am not reconciled.","Eh bien ! moi, je ne suis pas reconcilie !",3076,aligned
"If you were the man in the dark room, why were you also Sunday, an offense to the sunlight?","Si vous etiez l'homme des tenebres, pourquoi etiez-vous aussi Dimanche, cet outrage a la lumiere ?",3077,aligned

"Oh, I can forgive God His anger, though it destroyed nations; but I cannot forgive Him His peace.""","Oh ! ~~~ je pardonne a Dieu son courroux, meme quand ce courroux detruit des nations, mais je ne puis lui pardonner sa paix.",3080,aligned
"Sunday answered not a word, but very slowly he turned his face of stone upon Syme as if asking a question.","Dimanche ne repondit pas un mot ; mais il tourna sa figure de pierre vers Syme, comme pour l'interroger.",3081,aligned
"""No,"" said Syme, ""I do not feel fierce like that. I am grateful to you, not only for wine and hospitality here, but for many a fine scamper and free fight.'","-- Non, dit Syme, je ne suis pas aussi feroce.

"The falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam, like a bar of burning gold, across the dim grass.","Une derniere flamme du grand pot a feu jeta sur le gazon une derniere lueur, qui s'allongea comme une barre d'or fondu.",3092,aligned

"He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee-breeches such as that which was worn by the servants of the house, only that it was not blue, but of this absolute sable.","Il portait un habit etroit a la mode de jadis et des culottes a boucles, comme en portaient les valets du chateau, mais au lieu d'etre bleus, son habit et ses culottes etaient d'un noir absolu.",3094,aligned

"""You are right,"" said Gregory, and gazed all round.","-- Vous avez raison, dit Gregory en regardant autour de lui,",3101,aligned
"It was only when he had come quite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at them, that Syme saw, with thunder-struck clearness, that the face was the broad, almost ape-like face of his old friend Gregory, with its rank red hair and its insulting smile.","Quand il se fut approche tout pres du croissant des Sept Jours, quand il leva la tete pour les devisager, Syme, dans un eclair fulgurant, reconnut le large visage presque simiesque, les cheveux fauves et drus et le sourire insolent de son vieil ami Gregory.",3102,aligned
"A sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in Syme, and he spoke brokenly and without sequence.","Un sentiment de pathetique qui semblait venir des profondeurs de la terre s'empara de Syme, et il parla d'une facon saccadee et incoherente. ~~~ -- Oh !",3103,aligned

"They were walking like old friends, and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality.","Ils allaient, comme de vieux amis, et etaient engages dans une conversation sur quelque sujet de peu d'importance.",3151,aligned
