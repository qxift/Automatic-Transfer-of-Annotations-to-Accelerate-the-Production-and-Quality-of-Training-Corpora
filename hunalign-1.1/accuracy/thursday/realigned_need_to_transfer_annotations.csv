"The suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London, as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset.","Le faubourg de Saffron Park s'etendait a l'est de Londres, rouge et dechire comme un nuage au couchant,","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"It was built of a bright brick throughout; its sky-line was fantastic, and even its ground plan was wild.",toutes construites en briques claires. Le sol meme en etait etrangement tourmente.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"It had been the outburst of a speculative builder, faintly tinged with art, who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical.","On devait cette creation a la fantaisie d'un speculateur audacieux, qui possedait quelque vague teinture d'art. Il qualifiait l'architecture de son faubourg tantot de << style Elizabeth >>, tantot de << style reine Anne >> ; sans doute, dans sa pensee, les deux souveraines n'en faisaient qu'une.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"It was described with some justice as an artistic colony, though it never in any definable way produced any art.","Dans le public, on traitait ce faubourg de colonie d'artistes. Non qu'aucun art y fut particulierement cultive, mais l'aspect, l'atmosphere en etait << artiste >>.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague, its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable.","Endroit fort agreable, d'ailleurs, si ses pretentions au titre de centre intellectuel pouvaient passer pour exagerees.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
The stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them.,"L'etranger, qui jetait pour la premiere fois un regard sur ces curieuses maisons rouges, devait faire sans doute quelque effort d'imagination pour se representer la structure singuliere de leurs habitants.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
Nor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect.,"Et, s'il rencontrait l'un d'eux, son impression n'en etait pas modifiee.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"The place was not only pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream.","Cet endroit etait non seulement agreable, il etait parfait pour peu qu'on le considerat non comme truque mais plutot comme un reve.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"Even if the people were not ""artists,"" the whole was nevertheless artistic.","Si ce n'etaient pas des artistes qui habitaient la, l'ensemble n'en avait pas moins un caractere artiste.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"That young man with the long, auburn hair and the impudent face that young man was not really a poet; but surely he was a poem.","Ce jeune homme, par exemple, avec ses longs cheveux chatains et sa mine impertinente, ne voyez pas en lui un poete : c'est un poeme.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"That old gentleman with the wild, white beard and the wild, white hat that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others.","Ce vieux monsieur, avec sa vaste barbe sauvage et son vaste et sauvage chapeau, ce venerable charlatan, ce n'est pas un philosophe : c'est un theme de philosophie.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"That scientific gentleman with the bald, egg-like head and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed.","Ce personnage aux apparences doctorales, au crane chauve et brillant comme un oeuf, au long cou decharne comme celui d'un oiseau, n'a aucun droit aux dehors de savant qu'il se donne ;","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
He had not discovered anything new in biology; but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself?,il n'a fait aucune decouverte en biologie : mais n'est-il pas lui-meme la plus extraordinaire creature que puissent etudier les biologistes ?,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"Thus, and thus only, the whole place had properly to be regarded; it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished work of art.","Voila, disons-nous, le bon point de vue d'ou il convenait d'observer le faubourg de Saffron Park : non pas un atelier d'artistes, mais une oeuvre d'art, delicate et parfaite.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy.,"On avait, en y entrant, l'impression qu'on allait prendre part a quelque comedie.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall, when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud.","Ce charme de l'irreel etait surtout sensible le soir, quand les toits bizarres se decoupaient en valeurs sombres sur le couchant et que tout le chimerique endroit se detachait, en quelque sorte, visiblement du monde ordinaire, comme une nuee flotte dans le ciel.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"This again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often illuminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit.","Ce charme etait, veritablement, irresistible les soirs de fete locale, quand de grosses lanternes venitiennes, fruits monstrueux des arbres nains, illuminaient les jardinets.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"And this was strongest of all on one particular evening, still vaguely remembered in the locality, of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero.","Et ce charme fut plus sensible, plus irresistible que jamais, un certain soir dont on se souvient encore dans le voisinage et dont le poete aux cheveux chatains fut le heros.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
It was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero.,"Il avait ete, du reste, le heros de bien d'autres soirs avant celui-la.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"On many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high, didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women.","Il ne se passait guere de jour qu'on ne put entendre, des le crepuscule tombe, la voix haute et professorale de ce jeune homme dicter, du fond de son petit jardin, des lois a l'humanite entiere, et plus particulierement aux femmes.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place.,"L'attitude des femmes, dans ces occasions, etait meme fort remarquable.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"Most of the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated, and professed some protest against male supremacy.","Elles appartenaient presque toutes -- je parle de celles qui habitaient le faubourg -- a la categorie des emancipees, et faisaient en consequence profession de protester contre la suprematie du male.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"Yet these new women would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him, that of listening while he is talking.","Or, ces personnes << nouvelles >> etaient toujours disposees a vous accorder cet honneur que jamais aucune femme ordinaire n'accorde a aucun homme : elles vous ecoutaient tandis que vous parliez.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"And Mr. Lucian Gregory, the red-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening to, even if one only laughed at the end of it.","A vrai dire, M. Lucien Gregory meritait qu'on l'ecoutat, ne fut-ce que pour rire, ensuite, de ses discours.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure.,"Il debitait la vieille fable de l'anarchie de l'art et de l'art de l'anarchie avec une certaine fraicheur, un ragout d'insolence ou l'on pouvait trouver quelque bref agrement.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"He was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance, which he worked, as the phrase goes, for all it was worth.","L'originalite de son aspect physique le servait a souhait, et il savait en jouer, en connaissant la valeur.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"His dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman's, and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture.","Ses cheveux d'un rouge sombre, separes au milieu, etaient longs comme des cheveux de femme ; ils bouclaient en decrivant les molles courbes dont les peintres preraphaelites ne manquent pas d'agrementer les chevelures de leurs Vierges.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"From within this almost saintly oval, however, his face projected suddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt.",Mais de ce cadre mystique jaillissait une face large et brutale ; le menton avancait avec une expression meprisante qui sentait le cockney.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
This combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population.,"Ce contraste surexcitait jusqu'a la peur une galerie de femmes neurastheniques : elles goutaient ce blaspheme vivant, cette combinaison d'ange et de singe.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"This particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else, will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset.",La soiree dont il s'agit restera memorable tout au moins par son etonnant coucher de soleil.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
It looked like the end of the world.,Un coucher de soleil de fin du monde.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers, and of feathers that almost brushed the face.","Tout le ciel paraissait couvert d'un plumage palpable et vivant. Un ciel plein de plumes, de plumes qu'on croyait sentir vous effleurer le visage.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"Across the great part of the dome they were grey, with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green; but towards the west the whole grew past description, transparent and passionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen.","Au milieu du dome celeste, ces plumes etaient grises, avec de bizarres touches de violet, de mauve, de rose, de vert pale invraisemblablement. Mais il est impossible de rendre la transparence et le ton passionne de l'occident ; les dernieres plumes, d'un rouge feu, couvraient le soleil comme une chose trop belle pour que personne meritat de la voir.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"The whole was so close about the earth, as to express nothing but a violent secrecy.",Et tout cela etait si rapproche du sol qu'on ne pouvait s'expliquer le phenomene.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
The very empyrean seemed to be a secret.,L'empyree tout entier semblait l'expression d'un secret impenetrable.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism.,Il etait l'image et l'expression de cette splendide petitesse qui est l'ame du patriotisme local :,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
The very sky seemed small.,le ciel meme paraissait petit.,"[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky.,"Les uns, donc, se rappelleront cette soiree a cause de l'oppression que faisait peser le ciel ;","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
There are others who may remember it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the second poet of Saffron Park.,"les autres, parce qu'elle marqua l'apparition d'un second poete a Saffron Park.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
For a long time the red-haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended.,"Longtemps le revolutionnaire aux cheveux rouges avait regne sans rival. Le soir du fameux coucher de soleil, sa solitude prit subitement fin.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"The new poet, who introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very mild-looking mortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yellow hair.","Le nouveau poete, qui se presentait sous le nom de Gabriel Syme, avait les apparences d'un mortel de moeurs fort douces. Les cheveux d'or pale ; la barbe blonde, taillee en pointe.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked.,"On le soupconnait, toutefois, assez vite d'etre moins doux qu'il n'en avait l'air.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet, Gregory, upon the whole nature of poetry.","Son entree fut signalee par un differend entre lui et le poete etabli, Gregory, sur la nature meme de la poesie.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
"He said that he (Syme) was poet of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a poet of respectability.","Syme se donna pour le poete de la Loi, le poete de l'Ordre, -- bien plus : le poete des Convenances.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1
So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky.,"Les gens de Saffron Park le regarderent avec stupeur, comme s'il venait de tomber de l'impossible ciel de ce soir-la.","[55, 56, 58]",aligned,1

"The sword-stick and the brandy-flask, though in themselves only the tools of morbid conspirators, became the expressions of his own more healthy romance.","La canne a epee et la gourde de brandy, ces obligatoires et ridicules accessoires de tout conspirateur, devenaient pour lui l'expression de son propre romantisme.","[849, 851]",aligned,68
"The sword-stick became almost the sword of chivalry, and the brandy the wine of the stirrup-cup.","La canne a epee, c'etait le glaive du chevalier, et le brandy, le coup de l'etrier !","[849, 851]",aligned,68
"The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had gone down by the time that they passed Battersea, and when they came under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun to break.","Le clair de lune qui avait brille a Chiswick s'eteignit a Battersea, et, quand on arriva sous la masse enorme de Westminster, le jour commencait a poindre.","[858, 860, 871, 873, 874, 876]",aligned,69
"It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead, showing bars of silver; and these had brightened like white fire when the tug, changing its onward course, turned inward to a large landing stage rather beyond Charing Cross.","De grandes barres de plomb apparurent dans le ciel, puis s'effacerent sous des barres d'argent qui prirent bientot l'eclat du metal chauffe a blanc.

The great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic as Syme looked up at them.

"They made him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some Egyptian palace; and, indeed, the thing suited his mood, for he was, in his own mind, mounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings.","Syme crut aborder aux marches colossales de quelque palais d'Egypte. ~~~ L'idee lui plut.

At first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a pyramid; but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river.,"Tout d'abord, Syme crut l'escalier de pierre desert comme une pyramide. Mais, avant d'avoir atteint le dernier degre, il se rendit compte qu'il y avait un homme accoude au parapet, et que cet homme regardait le fleuve.","[858, 860, 871, 873, 874, 876]",aligned,69
"As a figure he was quite conventional, clad in a silk hat and frock-coat of the more formal type of fashion; he had a red flower in his buttonhole.",Son aspect etait tres ordinaire.

"As Syme drew nearer to him step by step, he did not even move a hair; and Syme could come close enough to notice even in the dim, pale morning light that his face was long, pale and intellectual, and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin, all else being clean-shaven.","De marche en marche, la distance diminuait entre eux ; l'homme ne bougeait pas. Syme put l'approcher d'assez pres pour observer, a la pale lumiere du matin, que la figure de l'inconnu etait longue, bleme, intelligente et se terminait par une touffe de barbe noire, les levres et les joues etant soigneusement rasees, et ces quelques poils semblaient oublies la, par simple negligence.","[858, 860, 871, 873, 874, 876]",aligned,69
"This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight; the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven clear-cut, ascetic, and in its way noble.","Cette figure anguleuse, ascetique, noble a sa facon, etait de celles auxquelles la barbe ne sied pas.","[858, 860, 871, 873, 874, 876]",aligned,69

"At first an instinct had told Syme that this was the man whom he was meant to meet. Then, seeing that the man made no sign, he had concluded that he was not. And now again he had come back to a certainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure.","Au premier regard, Syme avait eu l'intuition que cet homme etait la pour l'attendre.

"Then the man smiled, and his smile was a shock, for it was all on one side, going up in the right cheek and down in the left.","Alors, celui-ci sourit, d'un sourire inquietant, d'un sourire << d'un seul cote >>, qui haussait la joue droite et abaissait la gauche.","[878, 882, 883, 887, 889, 892, 894, 895, 904, 905, 907]",aligned,70

"But in all Syme's circumstances, with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones, there was something unnerving in it.","Mais, dans les circonstances ou se trouvait Syme, sous l'influence de cette aurore menacante, avec la mission meurtriere dont il etait charge, dans la solitude de ces grandes pierres ruisselantes, il recut de cet accueil une impression etrange, qui le glaca, qui le paralysa.","[878, 882, 883, 887, 889, 892, 894, 895, 904, 905, 907]",aligned,70

His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat.,"Et ce n'etait pas seulement parce qu'il etait extraordinairement haut de stature, et incroyablement gros, que cet homme paraissait si ample :","[929, 932, 933, 936, 937, 939]",aligned,73

"He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid, shining coffee-pot;","Il retrouva un peu de serenite en constatant que ses voisins etaient convenablement et normalement vetus, que la cafetiere etait brillante et solide.","[947, 951]",aligned,74
then he looked again at Sunday.,"Puis, il jeta de nouveau un regard sur Dimanche :","[947, 951]",aligned,74

In the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace;,"Comparee au President, toute la compagnie avait l'air passablement vulgaire.","[947, 951]",aligned,74

"Syme sprang erect upon the rocking car, and after staring wildly at the wintry sky, that grew gloomier every moment, he ran down the steps.","Syme se dressa de toute sa hauteur et, jetant un regard affole sur ce ciel d'hiver, qui d'instant en instant devenait plus sombre, se laissa glisser, plutot qu'il ne descendit, le long de l'escalier.","[1304, 1307]",aligned,98
He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the side.,"Il avait du reprimer un mouvement impulsif qu'il avait eu de se jeter en bas, du haut de l'imperiale.","[1304, 1307]",aligned,98

"Under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight, as of men under the sea.","Sous l'epais brouillard qui planait, la ville prenait une etrange couleur verdatre et comme sous-marine.","[1311, 1313, 1316, 1317, 1322, 1325]",aligned,99
"The sealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Paul's had in it smoky and sinister colours colours of sickly green, dead red or decaying bronze, that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow.","Derriere Saint-Paul, le soleil, comme un disque de metal, avait des teintes fumeuses et sinistres, morbides, des teintes d'un rouge fletri, d'un bronze terni, qui faisaient ressortir la blancheur opaque de la neige.","[1311, 1313, 1316, 1317, 1322, 1325]",aligned,99
"But right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral; and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow, still clinging as to an Alpine peak.","Sur ce fond morne, la masse noire de la cathedrale s'elevait, et a son sommet, on distinguait une grande tache de neige, comme sur un pic alpestre.","[1311, 1313, 1316, 1317, 1322, 1325]",aligned,99

There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left Syme in a final fury.,"Ce silence, cette sorte d'innocence jouee, exaspererent Syme.","[1335, 1342]",aligned,101
The man's colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident.,"Le vieillard semblait protester, tacitement, par son visage ferme, par ses manieres, en quelque sorte incolores, qu'il ne poursuivait personne et que toutes ces rencontres avaient ete de simples et insignifiantes coincidences.","[1335, 1342]",aligned,101
