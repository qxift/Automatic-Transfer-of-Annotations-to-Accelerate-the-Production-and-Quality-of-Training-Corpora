"Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;","Sir Walter Elliot, de Kellynch-Hall, dans le comte de Somerset, n'avait jamais touche un livre pour son propre amusement, si ce n'est le livre heraldique.",0,aligned
"Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years;","Lady Elliot avait ete une excellente femme, sensee et aimable, dont le jugement et la raison ne la tromperent jamais, si ce n'est en s'eprenant de Sir Walter. Elle supporta, cacha ou deguisa ses defauts, et pendant dix-sept ans le fit respecter.",1,aligned
His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.,Il dut a sa belle figure et a sa noblesse d'epouser une femme tres superieure a lui.,2,aligned
"He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.","A ses yeux, la beaute n'etait inferieure qu'a la noblesse, et le Sir Walter Elliot, qui reunissait tous ces dons, etait l'objet constant de son propre respect et de sa veneration.",3,aligned

"Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.","Trois filles, dont les ainees avaient, l'une seize ans, l'autre quatorze, furent un terrible heritage et une lourde charge pour un pere faible et vain.",20,aligned
"She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.","Mais elle avait une amie, femme sensee et respectable, qui s'etait decidee, par attachement pour elle, a habiter tout pres, au village de Kellynch. ~~~ Lady Elliot se reposa sur elle pour maintenir les bons principes qu'elle avait tache de donner a ses filles.",21,aligned
"Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow.","Treize annees s'etaient ecoulees depuis la mort de lady Elliot, et ils restaient proches voisins et amis intimes, mais rien de plus.",22,aligned
"That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.","Il n'est pas etonnant que lady Russel n'eut pas songe a un second mariage ; car elle possedait une belle fortune, etait d'un age mur, et d'un caractere serieux, mais le celibat de Sir Walter s'explique moins facilement.",23,aligned
"Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.","Des lors, il se posa comme un bon pere qui se devoue pour ses filles.",24,aligned
"For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not been very much tempted to do.","En realite, pour l'ainee seule, il etait dispose a faire quelque chose, mais a condition de ne pas se gener.",25,aligned

His two other children were of very inferior value.,"Les deux autres filles de Sir Walter etaient, a son avis, d'une valeur inferieure.",27,aligned
"Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.","Marie avait acquis une legere importance en devenant Mme Musgrove ; mais Anna, avec une distinction d'esprit et une douceur de caractere que toute personne intelligente savait apprecier, n'etait rien pour son pere, ni pour sa soeur.

"To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite, and friend.","Lady Russel aimait ses soeurs, mais dans Anna seulement elle voyait revivre son amie.",29,aligned

"A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.","Quelques annees auparavant, Anna etait une tres jolie fille, mais sa fraicheur disparut vite, et son pere, qui ne l'admirait guere quand elle etait dans tout son eclat, car ses traits delicats et ses doux yeux bruns etaient trop differents des siens, ne trouvait plus rien en elle qui put exciter son estime, maintenant qu'elle etait fanee et amincie.",31,aligned
"He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.",Il n'avait jamais espere voir le nom d'Anna sur une autre page de son livre favori.,32,aligned
"All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.","Toute alliance egale reposait sur Elisabeth, car Marie, entree dans une notable et riche famille de province, lui avait fait plus d'honneur qu'elle n'en avait recu. ~~~ Un jour ou l'autre, Elisabeth se marierait selon son rang.",33,aligned

"It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost.","Il arrive parfois qu'une femme est plus belle a vingt-neuf ans que dix ans plus tot. ~~~ Quand elle n'a eu ni chagrins, ni maladies, c'est souvent une epoque de la vie ou la beaute n'a rien perdu de ses charmes.",35,aligned
"It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing.","Chez Elisabeth, il en etait ainsi : c'etait toujours la belle miss Elliot, et Sir Elliot etait a moitie excusable d'oublier l'age de sa fille, et de se croire lui-meme aussi jeune qu'autrefois au milieu des ruines qui l'entouraient.",36,aligned
"Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.","Il voyait avec chagrin Anna se faner, Marie grossir, ses voisins vieillir et les rides se creuser rapidement autour des yeux de lady Russel.",37,aligned
Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.,Elisabeth n'etait pas aussi satisfaite que son pere.,38,aligned
"Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was.","Depuis treize ans, elle etait maitresse de Kellynch-Hall, presidant et dirigeant avec une assurance et une decision qui ne la rajeunissaient pas.",39,aligned
"The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor.","Le domaine de Kellynch etait bon, mais insuffisant pour la representation que Sir Walter jugeait necessaire.",40,aligned
"While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.","Tant qu'avait vecu lady Elliot, l'ordre, la moderation et l'economie avaient contenu les depenses dans les limites des revenus ; mais cet equilibre avait disparu avec elle : les dettes augmentaient ;",41,aligned
"It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.","elles etaient connues, et il devenait impossible de les cacher entierement a Elisabeth.",42,aligned
"He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, ""Can we retrench? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?"" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.","L'hiver dernier, Sir Walter avait propose deja quelques diminutions dans les depenses, et, pour rendre justice a Elisabeth, elle avait indique deux reformes : supprimer quelques charites inutiles, et ne point renouveler l'ameublement du salon. Elle eut aussi l'heureuse idee de ne plus donner d'etrennes a Anna.",43,aligned
"But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.","Mais ces mesures etaient insuffisantes ; Sir Walter fut oblige de le confesser,",44,aligned
"Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy. She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.","et Elisabeth ne trouva pas d'autre remede plus efficace. Comme lui, elle se trouvait malheureuse et maltraitee par le sort.",45,aligned
"He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell. No; he would never disgrace his name so far.

"She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.","Elle savait qu'il etait venu habiter la baronnie pour payer ses lourdes dettes, et pour mettre fin aux insinuations desagreables de son homme d'affaires, M.

"Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride.","Les deux amis intimes, M. Shepherd et lady Russel, furent appeles a donner un conseil ; ils devaient trouver quelque expedient pour reduire les depenses sans faire souffrir Sir Walter et sa fille dans leur orgueil ou dans leurs fantaisies.",48,aligned

"Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.","Treize hivers l'avaient vue ouvrir chaque bal de ceremonie donne dans le voisinage, et les fleurs de treize printemps avaient fleuri depuis qu'elle allait, avec son pere, jouir des plaisirs de Londres pendant quelques semaines.",50,aligned
"For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.","Pendant treize ans, elle avait fait les honneurs du logis, etablissant les lois domestiques, assise dans le landau a la place d'honneur, et ayant le pas immediatement apres lady Russel dans tous les salons et a tous les diners.",51,aligned
"She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.","Elle se rappelait tout cela, et la conscience de ses vingt-neuf ans lui donnait des apprehensions et quelques regrets. Elle se savait aussi belle que jamais, mais elle sentait s'approcher les annees dangereuses, et aurait voulu etre demandee par quelque baronnet avant la fin de l'annee.",52,aligned
"There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.","Sir Walter ne pouvait disposer que d'une petite partie de son domaine, et encore etait-elle hypothequee. Jamais il n'aurait voulu vendre, se deshonorer a ce point.",53,aligned

"Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not.","Elle aurait pu alors feuilleter le livre par excellence avec autant de joie qu'autrefois ; mais voir toujours la date de sa naissance, et pas d'autre mariage que celui de sa jeune soeur, lui rendait le livre odieux ;",55,aligned
"Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.","Telles etaient les pensees d'Elisabeth ; telles etaient les preoccupations et les agitations destinees a varier la monotonie de sa vie elegante, oisive et somptueuse, et a remplir les vides qu'aucune habitude utile au dehors, aucuns talents a l'interieur ne venaient occuper.",56,aligned
"The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her.","L'heritier presomptif, ce meme William Walter Elliot dont les droits avaient ete si genereusement reconnus par son pere, avait refuse sa main.",57,aligned
"She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.",D'ailleurs elle avait eu une deception que ce livre lui rappelait toujours.,58,aligned
"Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away.","et plus d'une fois, le voyant ouvert, elle le repoussa en detournant les yeux.",59,aligned
"He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.","Apres la mort de sa femme, Sir Walter rechercha la connaissance d'Elliot. Ses ouvertures ne furent pas recues avec empressement, mais il persevera, mettant tout sur le compte de la timidite du jeune homme. Dans un de leurs voyages a Londres, Elisabeth etait alors dans tout l'eclat de sa beaute et de sa fraicheur, William ne put refuser une invitation.",60,aligned
"But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these.",Mais bientot d'autres preoccupations s'ajouterent a celles-la :,61,aligned
"He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed.","C'etait alors un jeune etudiant en droit, Elisabeth le trouva extremement agreable et se confirma dans ses projets.",62,aligned
He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.,"Il fut invite a Kellynch. On en parla et on l'attendit jusqu'au bout de l'annee, mais il ne vint pas.",63,aligned
"The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married.","Le printemps suivant, on le revit a Londres. Les memes avances lui furent faites, mais en vain. Enfin on apprit qu'il etait marie.",64,aligned
"She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.","Quand elle etait toute petite fille, et qu'elle esperait n'avoir point de frere, elle avait songe deja a epouser William, et c'etait aussi l'intention de son pere.",65,aligned
"Sir Walter had resented it. As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; ""For they must have been seen together,"" he observed, ""once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons.""","Sir Walter fut irrite ; il aurait voulu etre consulte, comme chef de famille, surtout apres avoir fait si publiquement des avances au jeune homme ; car on les avait vus ensemble au Tattersall et a la Chambre des Communes.",66,aligned
"This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot's eldest daughter.","Elisabeth se rappelait cette histoire avec colere ; elle avait aime l'homme pour lui-meme et plus encore parce qu'il etait l'heritier de Sir Walter ; avec lui seul, son orgueil voyait un mariage convenable, elle le reconnaissait pour son egal.",67,aligned
"Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth.","Au lieu de chercher fortune dans la voie tracee a l'heritier de Sir Walter, il avait achete l'independance en epousant une femme riche, de naissance inferieure.",68,aligned
"Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.","Cependant il s'etait si mal conduit, qu'il meritait d'etre oublie.",69,aligned
"The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.","On aurait pu lui pardonner son mariage, car on ne lui supposait pas d'enfants, mais il avait parle legerement et meme avec mepris de la famille Elliot et des honneurs qui devaient etre les siens.",70,aligned
This could not be pardoned.,On ne pouvait lui pardonner cela.,71,aligned
There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.,(No direct equivalent in text),72,not aligned

"And with regard to Anne's dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising, first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself.","Lady Russel considerait l'antipathie d'Anna pour Bath comme une prevention erronee provenant de trois annees de pension passees la apres la mort de sa mere, et en second lieu de ce qu'elle n'etait pas en bonne disposition d'esprit pendant le seul hiver qu'elle y eut passe avec elle.",124,aligned

"The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.","Les messieurs Musgrove avaient leur chasse, leurs chevaux, leurs chiens, leurs journaux. ~~~ Les dames avaient les soins d'interieur, la toilette, les voisins, la danse et la musique.",421,aligned
"She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.","Anna se promettait de ne plus eprouver a l'avenir de telles deceptions, et pensait avec reconnaissance au bonheur inexprimable d'avoir une amie vraie et sympathique comme lady Russel.",422,aligned

"or in the young ladies' addition of, ""I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!""","Ou bien, Marie disait : << En verite !",424,aligned
"Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments;","Anna les trouvait fort heureuses ; mais cependant, soutenue, comme nous le sommes tous, par le sentiment de sa superiorite, elle n'aurait pas voulu changer contre toutes leurs jouissances son esprit cultive et elegant.",425,aligned
"or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--""Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!""",comme je m'amuserai seule ici pendant que vous serez a Bath ! >>,426,aligned
They were received with great cordiality.,"Elles furent recues tres cordialement,",427,aligned
"Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.",et Anna ne trouva rien a critiquer.,428,aligned
"and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters.","Elle n'enviait que la bonne intelligence qui semblait regner entre elles, et cette mutuelle affection qu'elle-meme avait si peu connue.",429,aligned
"Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.","Anna n'avait pas besoin de cette visite pour savoir qu'un changement de societe amene un changement total de conversation, d'opinions et d'idees.",430,aligned
"She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest;","Elle aurait voulu que les Elliot pussent voir combien leurs affaires, traitees avec une telle solennite a Kellynch, avaient ici peu d'importance.",431,aligned
"yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;","Cependant elle sentit qu'elle avait encore besoin d'une lecon, car elle avait compte sur plus de curiosite et de sympathie qu'elle n'en trouva.",432,aligned
"for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: ""So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in?"" and this, without much waiting for an answer;","On lui avait bien dit : << Ainsi, miss Anna, votre pere et votre soeur sont partis ? >> Ou bien : << J'espere que nous irons aussi a Bath cet hiver ; mais nous comptons loger dans un beau quartier. >>",433,aligned
"The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation.","La demi-heure s'ecoula en causerie agreable, et Anna ne fut pas peu surprise de voir les misses Musgrove les accompagner a la promenade sur l'invitation pressante de Marie.",434,aligned
"As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.","Il ne mettait beaucoup d'ardeur a rien, si ce n'est au jeu, et il gaspillait son temps.",435,aligned
"He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple.","Il etait d'un caractere gai, s'affectant peu des doleances de sa femme ; il supportait son manque de bon sens avec une patience qui emerveillait Anna, et en definitive, malgre quelques petites querelles (ou les deux parties appelaient Anna, a son grand regret), ce couple pouvait passer pour heureux.",436,aligned
"They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.",Il y avait une chose sur laquelle ils etaient toujours parfaitement d'accord : le besoin d'argent et le desir de recevoir un cadeau de M. Musgrove.,437,aligned
"""I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary's interference,"" was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;","<< Je les gouvernerais tres bien, si Marie ne s'en melait pas, >> disait-il, et Anna trouvait que c'etait assez vrai.",438,aligned
"but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of ""Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,"" she never had the smallest temptation to say, ""Very true.""","Mais quand Marie repondait a cela : << Charles gate tellement les enfants que je ne puis en venir a bout, >> Anna n'etait jamais tentee de dire que c'etait vrai.",439,aligned
"One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.","Ce qu'il y avait de moins agreable dans son sejour, c'etait d'etre la confidente de tous les partis.",440,aligned
"Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.","On savait qu'elle avait quelque influence sur sa soeur, et l'on voulait qu'elle s'en servit, meme au dela du possible.",441,aligned
"As to the management of their children, his theory was much better than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.","Quant a l'education de leurs enfants, la theorie de Charles etait meilleure que celle de sa femme.",442,aligned
"""I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,"" was Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: ""I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was anything the matter with me.","<< Tachez donc de persuader a Marie de ne pas toujours se croire malade, >> disait Charles. ~~~ Et Marie disait : << Je crois que si Charles me voyait mourante, il dirait encore que ce n'est rien.",443,aligned
"I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever own.""","Vous pouvez, Anna, lui persuader que je suis plus malade que je ne l'avoue.",444,aligned
"Mary's declaration was, ""I hate sending the children to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day.""",">> Ou bien : << Je n'aime pas a envoyer les enfants a Great-House, quoique leur grand'mere les demande toujours. ~~~ Elle les gate tellement, et leur donne tant de friandises qu'ils reviennent malades et grognons pour le reste de la journee.",445,aligned
"And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne, to say, ""Oh!",">> Et Mme Musgrove mere, aussitot qu'elle etait seule avec Anna, disait : << Ah !",446,aligned
"Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.",miss Anna ! ~~~ si seulement Mme Charles avait un peu de votre methode avec les enfants !,447,aligned
They are quite different creatures with you!,Ils sont tout autres avec vous !,448,aligned
"But to be sure, in general they are so spoilt!",Il faut convenir qu'ils sont bien gates !,449,aligned
It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them. (No direct equivalent in text),Il faut convenir qu'ils sont bien gates !,450,aligned
"They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;","Ils sont aussi beaux et aussi bien portants que possible, les chers petits,",451,aligned
but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!,mais ma belle-fille ne sait pas s'y prendre avec eux !,452,aligned
Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.,Mon Dieu ! qu'ils sont ennuyeux quelquefois !,453,aligned
"I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should.",Je vous assure que c'est la ce qui m'empeche de les avoir autant que je voudrais.,454,aligned
"I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment; ""don't do this,"" and ""don't do that;"" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them."" ~~~ She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.","Je crois que Marie est mecontente que je ne les invite pas plus souvent, mais vous savez combien il est desagreable d'avoir des enfants qu'il faut gronder a chaque instant : << Ne faites pas ceci, ne touchez pas a cela, >> ou qu'on ne peut tenir tranquilles qu'en leur donnant trop de gateaux.",455,aligned
"""Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.",>> Marie disait encore : << Mme Musgrove croit ses domestiques si fideles que ce serait un crime de mettre cela en question ; mais je n'exagere pas en disant que sa cuisiniere et sa femme de chambre flanent toute la journee dans le village.,456,aligned
"I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them.","Je les rencontre partout, et je ne vais pas deux fois dans la chambre des enfants sans rencontrer l'une des deux.",457,aligned
"Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.","Excepte pendant une courte periode de sa vie, elle n'avait jamais, depuis la mort de sa mere cherie, connu le bonheur d'etre ecoutee et encouragee.",458,aligned
"The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.","Il y avait peu de voisins, mais les Musgrove voyaient tout le monde, et avaient plus de diners et de visites qu'aucune autre famille.",459,aligned
She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.,Elle savait depuis longtemps qu'en jouant elle ne faisait plaisir qu'a elle-meme.,460,aligned
"It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.",(No direct equivalent in text),461,not aligned
They were more completely popular.,Ils etaient tres populaires.,462,aligned
"In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own.","Elle y etait accoutumee, et la partialite de M. et Mme Musgrove pour leurs filles, loin de la vexer, lui faisait plutot plaisir, a cause de l'amitie qu'elle leur portait.",463,aligned
The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.,Quelques personnes augmentaient parfois le cercle de Great-House.,464,aligned
"If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.""","Si Jemina n'etait pas la creature la plus fidele et la plus sure, cela suffirait pour la gater.",465,aligned
"Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.","le changement de place lui fit du bien, et Marie, ayant une compagne assidue, se plaignit moins. Les relations quotidiennes avec l'autre famille etaient tres agreables, mais Anna pensait que tout n'aurait pas ete si bien sans la presence de M. et de Mme Musgrove, ou les rires, les causeries et les chansons des jeunes filles.",466,aligned
"In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.",Sa visite eut du reste un bon resultat ;,467,aligned
"She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister's benefit.","Elle ne pouvait qu'ecouter patiemment, apaiser les griefs ; excuser l'un, puis l'autre ; les engager a l'indulgence necessaire entre voisins, surtout quand il s'agissait de sa soeur.",468,aligned
How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?,Comment Anna aurait-elle pu concilier tout le monde ?,469,aligned
"It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many persons.""","Ce n'est pas que maman s'en soucie le moins du monde, mais beaucoup de personnes le remarquent.",470,aligned
"Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.","Personne ne doute de son droit a cet egard, mais il serait plus convenable de ne pas toujours le garder.",471,aligned
"And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, ""I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.","Un jour qu'Anna se promenait avec les misses Musgrove, l'une d'elles, parlant de noblesse et de susceptibilites de rang, dit : << Je n'ai aucun scrupule a vous dire, parce qu'on sait que vous y etes indifferente, combien quelques personnes sont absurdes pour garder leur rang. Cependant je voudrais qu'on put faire comprendre a Marie qu'elle ne devrait pas etre si tenace, et surtout ne pas se mettre toujours a la place de ma mere.",472,aligned
"Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.","Marie se plaignait aussi de n'avoir pas a table la place qui lui etait due. Quand, a Great-House, il y avait d'autres invites, on la placait comme si elle etait de la maison.",473,aligned
"Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of mentioning it.""","C'en est assez pour perdre tous les autres domestiques. Marie ne voit que par ses yeux ; mais je vous avertis : soyez sur vos gardes, parce que, si vous decouvrez quelque chose, il ne faut pas craindre de le dire.",474,aligned
"And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, ""I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.","Et Mme Musgrove : << Je me fais une loi de ne jamais me meler des affaires de ma belle-fille, mais je vous dirai, miss Anna, (parce que vous pouvez y remedier), que je n'ai pas bonne opinion de sa femme de chambre, j'entends d'etranges histoires. Elle est toujours dehors, et s'habille comme une dame.",475,aligned
"The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally, in an unpremeditated little ball.","Les jeunes filles aimaient passionnement la danse, et les soirees se terminaient souvent par un petit bal improvise.",476,aligned
"She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware.","Elle etait meilleure musicienne que celles-ci ; mais, n'ayant ni voix, ni connaissance de la harpe, ni parents indulgents pour s'extasier sur son jeu, on ne pensait guere a lui demander de jouer, sinon par simple politesse, ou pour laisser reposer les autres.",477,aligned
"There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--""Well done, Miss Anne! ~~~ very well done indeed!","A quelques minutes d'Uppercross habitait une famille de cousins, moins riches, qui recevaient tous leurs plaisirs des Musgrove. ~~~ Ils venaient n'importe quand, organisaient un jeu ou un bal a l'improviste, et Anna, qui preferait a un role plus actif s'asseoir au piano, leur jouait des danses de village pendant une heure de suite, obligeance qui attirait sur son talent musical l'attention des Musgrove, et lui valait souvent ce compliment : << Tres bien, miss Anna, tres bien, vraiment.",478,aligned

"how those little fingers of yours fly about!""",Comme vos petits doigts courent sur le piano !,480,aligned
So passed the first three weeks. ~~~ Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart must be in Kellynch again.,">> Ainsi passerent les trois premieres semaines, puis vint la Saint-Michel, et le coeur d'Anna retourna a Kellynch.",481,aligned
"A beloved home made over to others; all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!","La maison aimee occupee par d'autres ! ~~~ D'autres gens jouissant des chambres, des meubles, des bosquets et des points de vue !",482,aligned
"She could not think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, ""Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?","Elle ne put penser a autre chose le 29 septembre, et Marie, remarquant le quantieme du mois, fit cette sympathique remarque : << Mon Dieu ! ~~~ n'est-ce pas aujourd'hui que les Croft entrent a Kellynch ?",483,aligned
"She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.","Elle desirait cependant voir les Croft, et fut contente d'etre a la maison quand ils rendirent la visite.",484,aligned
"but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.","Neanmoins elle n'eut pas un moment de repos tant que Charles ne l'y eut pas conduite, et, quand elle revint, son agitation n'avait rien que d'agreable.",485,aligned

"They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.","Charles etait absent. ~~~ Tandis que l'amiral, assis pres de Marie, se rendait agreable en s'occupant des petits garcons, Mme Croft s'entretenait avec Anna, qui put ainsi etablir une ressemblance avec son frere, sinon dans les traits, du moins dans la voix et la tournure d'esprit.",493,aligned
"Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.","Mme Croft, sans etre grande ni grosse, avait une carrure et une prestance qui donnaient de l'importance a sa personne.",494,aligned
"She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.","Elle avait de brillants yeux noirs, de belles dents et une figure agreable ; mais son teint hale et rougi par la vie sur mer lui donnait quelques annees de plus que ses trente-huit ans.",495,aligned
"Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.","Ses manieres ouvertes, aisees et decidees n'avaient aucune rudesse et ne manquaient pas de bonne humeur.",496,aligned
"Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.","Anna crut avec plaisir aux sentiments de consideration exprimes pour la famille et pour elle-meme, car, des le premier moment, elle s'etait assuree que Mme Croft n'avait aucun soupcon du passe.",497,aligned
"She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,-- ""It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.""","Tranquille sur ce point, elle se sentait pleine de force et de courage, quand ces mots de Mme Croft lui donnerent un coup subit : << C'est vous, n'est-ce pas, et non votre soeur que mon frere eut le plaisir de connaitre quand il etait dans ce pays ?",498,aligned
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not.,>> Anna esperait avoir depasse l'age ou l'on rougit ; mais certainement elle fut emue.,499,aligned

"He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.",">> Il fut interrompu par les petits garcons, qui s'accrochaient a lui comme a un vieil ami et ne voulaient pas le laisser partir : il leur offrit de les emporter dans ses poches, et fut bientot trop accapare pour finir sa phrase ou se souvenir de ce qu'il avait dit.",505,aligned
"When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they? ), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow!","Mme Croft nous a dit ce matin que son frere, le capitaine Wenvorth, est rentre en Angleterre, et ira prochainement les voir.

"""And I will tell you our reason,"" she added, ""and all about it.

"That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.","Tout a coup Louisa entra seule, disant qu'elle etait venue a pied pour laisser plus de place a la harpe qu'on apportait.",508,aligned

"She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.","Anna tacha de se persuader qu'il s'agissait toujours d'Edouard Wenvorth ; mais cela ne l'empecha point de se demander si l'on avait parle de cela dans l'autre maison, ou les Croft etaient alles d'abord.",510,aligned
"And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!

"He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him ""poor Richard,"" been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead.","Ses soeurs faisaient aujourd'hui pour lui tout ce qu'elles pouvaient faire en l'appelant << pauvre Richard >>, mais en realite il n'avait ete rien de plus que le lourd, insensible et inutile Dick Musgrove ; n'ayant droit, vivant ou mort, qu'a ce diminutif de son nom.",513,aligned

"He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money.","Il avait ete plusieurs annees en mer, et dans le cours de ces changements frequents pour les mousses dont le capitaine desire se debarrasser, il avait ete six mois sur la fregate Laconia, commandee par le capitaine Frederic Wenvorth, et sous l'influence de ce dernier, il avait ecrit a ses parents les deux seules lettres desinteressees qu'ils eussent jamais recues de lui ; les autres n'etaient que des demandes d'argent.",515,aligned
"In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.","Il disait toujours du bien de son capitaine, mais ses parents s'en souciaient si peu qu'ils n'y avaient fait aucune attention, et si Mme Musgrove fut frappee par le nom de Wenvorth associe avec celui de son fils, c'etait par un de ces phenomenes de la memoire assez frequents chez les personnes distraites.",516,aligned
"She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death.","Elle avait relu les lettres de ce fils perdu pour toujours, et cette lecture, apres un si long intervalle, alors que les fautes etaient oubliees, l'avait affectee plus profondement que la nouvelle de sa mort.",517,aligned
"Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.","M. Musgrove l'etait aussi, mais a un moindre degre, et en arrivant au cottage ils avaient besoin d'etre ecoutes et egayes.",518,aligned
"To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.","Ce fut une nouvelle epreuve pour Anna d'entendre parler de Wenvorth, et repeter son nom si souvent, d'entendre disputer sur les dates, et affirmer enfin que ce ne pouvait etre que le capitaine Wenvorth, ce beau jeune homme qu'on avait rencontre plusieurs fois en revenant de Clifton huit annees auparavant.",519,aligned
"She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.","Elle vit qu'il fallait s'accoutumer a ce supplice, et tacher de devenir insensible a cette arrivee.",520,aligned
"Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points.","Non seulement il etait attendu prochainement, mais les Musgrove, reconnaissants des bontes qu'il avait eues pour leur fils, et pleins de respect pour le caractere que Dick leur avait depeint, desiraient vivement faire sa connaissance.",521,aligned
"And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as ""a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,"" were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival.",(No direct equivalent in text),522,not aligned

"A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week.","Quelques jours plus tard, on sut que le capitaine etait a Kellynch. M. Musgrove lui fit visite et revint enchante. Il l'avait invite a diner avec les Croft pour la semaine suivante, et n'avait pu, a son grand regret, fixer un jour plus rapproche.",525,aligned
"It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.",(No direct equivalent in text),526,not aligned
"But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.","Anna calcula qu'elle n'avait plus qu'une semaine de tranquillite ; mais elle faillit rencontrer le capitaine, qui rendit aussitot a M. Musgrove sa visite.",527,aligned
"So here he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child.","Ainsi, il va s'amuser, et parce que je suis la pauvre mere, il ne m'est pas permis de bouger ; et cependant je suis moins capable que personne de soigner l'enfant.",528,aligned

"She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only Anne to hear-- ""So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening! I knew how it would be.","<< Ainsi on nous laisse seules nous distraire comme nous pourrons avec ce pauvre enfant malade, et pas une ame pour nous tenir compagnie le soir.

Au retour de la chasse, il declara audacieusement qu'il allait s'habiller et diner chez son pere.",537,aligned

"It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars.",(No direct equivalent in text),540,not aligned
"It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer confinement.","L'enfant devait rester couche, et s'amuser aussi tranquillement que possible.",541,aligned
"Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; ""the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.""","Mais bientot Charles changea d'avis ; puisque l'enfant allait si bien, il pouvait aller passer une heure a Great-House apres le diner.",542,aligned
"""Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,"" both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.","Ils ne voudraient sans doute pas quitter l'enfant. << Oh ! ~~~ non, >> s'ecrierent le pere et la mere.",543,aligned
"The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy, to give him the meeting.","La meme histoire et les memes ravissements se repeterent le soir, quand elles vinrent avec leur pere prendre des nouvelles de l'enfant. M. Musgrove confirma ces louanges. Il ne pouvait reculer l'invitation faite le matin au capitaine, et regrettait que les habitants du cottage ne pussent venir aussi.",544,aligned
"And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.","Elles s'echapperent en courant, plus occupees du capitaine que du petit garcon.",545,aligned
"How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought.",(No direct equivalent in text),546,not aligned

"Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of Captain Wentworth's visit;","Cependant il donna bon espoir, et l'on put aller diner plus tranquillement.

No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.

"Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them; an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard.","Wenthrop, qu'on apercut alors en bas, etait une laide et vulgaire maison, a toit peu eleve, entouree de granges et de batiments de ferme.",917,aligned

"Could Anne have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance.","Si Anna avait pu le prevoir, elle serait restee a la maison.",923,aligned
"Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep with her brother and sister.","Quand le chemin devenait plus etroit, Anna s'arrangeait pour marcher avec son frere et sa soeur ; elle ne voulait pas gener les autres.",924,aligned
"Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.","Son plaisir a elle etait l'air et l'exercice, la vue des derniers rayons de soleil sur les feuilles jaunies ; et aussi de se repeter tout bas quelques-unes des poetiques descriptions de l'automne, saison qui a une si puissante influence sur les ames delicates et tendres.",925,aligned
"She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves, she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.","Tout en occupant son esprit de ces reveries, de ces citations, il lui fut impossible de ne pas entendre la conversation du capitaine avec les deux soeurs.",926,aligned

Oh! it does happen very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as lieve be tossed out as not.""","Apres avoir admire a plusieurs reprises cette splendide journee, le capitaine ajouta : << Quel beau temps pour l'amiral et pour ma soeur !

"""Ah! You make the most of it, I know,"" cried Louisa, ""but if it were really so, I should do just the same in her place.

"Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief.

"They would not listen to scruples: he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them.","Tandis que Mme Harville faisait porter Louisa dans son propre lit, son mari administrait a tous des soins, des cordiaux.",1186,aligned
She must be taken to their house; all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.,Il ne voulut ecouter aucune objection et fut obei.,1187,aligned

"To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they had passed along.","Henriette fut confiee a l'un d'eux. Anna marchait a cote de Louisa. Charles soutenait sa femme : ils reprirent le chemin qu'ils venaient de traverser si joyeux, un moment auparavant, maintenant si desoles !",1191,aligned
"By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first report.",Le bruit de l'accident s'etait bientot repandu.

"That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may be conceived.",Ils en ressentirent tous une joie profonde et l'on adressa au ciel les plus fervents remerciements.,1197,aligned
"They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.",~~~ Les Harville vinrent a leur rencontre.,1198,aligned
"The tone, the look, with which ""Thank God!"" was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.","Anna se dit qu'elle n'oublierait jamais le regard et l'accent de Wenvorth disant : << Dieu soit loue ! >> non plus que son attitude, les bras croises sur la table, et la tete dans ses mains, comme s'il etait ecrase par ses emotions, et cherchait a se calmer par la priere et le silence.",1199,aligned
"One thing more, and all seemed arranged. Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.","Wenvorth proposa de prendre une chaise de poste pour aller plus vite ; et d'envoyer demain, de bonne heure, l'equipage a Uppercross pour donner des nouvelles de Louisa.",1200,aligned
"Why was not she to be as useful as Anne? And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband! No, it was too unkind. And in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.","Non, c'etait vraiment trop dur ! ~~~ Elle en dit tant que Charles dut ceder.",1201,aligned
"She expressed herself most willing, ready, happy to remain. ""It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do. A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so.""","Elle dit qu'elle etait prete, et heureuse de rester, qu'elle y avait pense, et souhaite qu'on lui permit de le faire. Un lit a terre dans la chambre de Louisa lui suffirait, si Mme Harville le trouvait bon.",1202,aligned
"Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending to her.","Jamais Anna ne s'etait soumise avec plus de repugnance aux fantaisies jalouses de Marie. Elle partit pour la ville, avec Henriette, Charles et Benwick.",1203,aligned
"She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning. There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.","Pendant le trajet, elle revit les endroits qui lui rappelaient les plus petits details de la matinee : ici elle avait ecoute les projets d'Henriette ; plus loin, elle avait vu M. Elliot ; mais elle ne put donner qu'un moment a tout ce qui n'etait pas Louisa.",1204,aligned
"Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.","Le capitaine Benwick fut tres attentif pour Anna ; l'accident arrive ce jour-la les avait tous unis davantage ; elle sentait pour lui un redoublement de bienveillance, et pensait meme avec plaisir que c'etait peut-etre une occasion pour elle et lui de se connaitre davantage.",1205,aligned
"Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.","Wenvorth les attendait avec une chaise de poste au bas de la rue. Anna fut froissee de son air surpris quand il la vit venir au lieu de Marie, et de l'exclamation qui lui echappa quand Charles lui eut dit pourquoi. Elle crut qu'elle n'etait appreciee qu'en raison de son utilite.",1206,aligned
"She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just. Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.","Elle s'efforca d'etre calme et juste. Pour l'amour de Wenvorth, elle eut soigne Louisa avec un zele infatigable. Elle espera qu'il ne serait pas longtemps assez injuste pour croire qu'elle avait recule devant cette tache.",1207,aligned
"In the meanwhile she was in the carriage. He had handed them both in, and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.","Apres avoir aide Henriette a monter, Wenvorth s'assit entre elles deux ; ce fut ainsi qu'Anna etonnee et emue, quitta Lyme.",1208,aligned
"How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.",Ce long trajet modifierait-il leurs relations ? quelle serait la conversation ? Elle ne pouvait rien prevoir.,1209,aligned
"It was all quite natural, however. He was devoted to Henrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits. In general, his voice and manner were studiously calm. To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle.","Il s'occupa d'Henriette, se tournant toujours vers elle, cherchant a soutenir son espoir, a relever son courage. Il tachait d'avoir l'air calme pour lui epargner toute agitation.",1210,aligned
"She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away.","Elle rougit fortement, et lui, reprenant possession de lui-meme, s'eloigna.",1211,aligned
"The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then appeared. ""You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;"" cried he, turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which seemed almost restoring the past.","Elle entra dans la chambre. << Vous resterez pour la soigner, j'en suis sur, lui dit-il avec un elan et une douceur qui semblaient rappeler le passe. >>",1212,aligned

"Captain Benwick must give up his room to them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.",Mme Harville offrait de se charger de Louisa : c'etait une garde-malade experte ; et sa bonne d'enfants etait une seconde elle-meme.,1220,aligned
"The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door was open. ""Then it is settled, Musgrove,"" cried Captain Wentworth, ""that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home. But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be only one. Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne.""","A ce moment, Anna, sortant de la chambre de Louisa, entendit Wenvorth qui disait : << C'est entendu, Musgrove, vous restez, et je ramene votre soeur a la maison. Mais si quelqu'un reste ici pour aider Mme Harville, ce ne peut etre que miss Anna, si elle le veut bien : elle a toutes les qualites pour cela ; d'ailleurs votre femme veut sans doute retourner aupres de ses enfants. >>",1221,aligned
"They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet perhaps, by ""putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging a cot somewhere,"" they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.","Louisa serait veillee nuit et jour. Tout cela fut dit d'un accent sincere et vrai, qui etait irresistible.",1222,aligned
"Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.","Charles, Anna et Wenvorth se demandaient avec effroi comment on pourrait porter la triste nouvelle a Uppercross.",1223,aligned
"""Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.""","La matinee etait fort avancee. On se desolait, quand Wenvorth s'ecria : << Il n'y a pas de temps a perdre, les minutes sont precieuses.",1224,aligned
"At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth, exerting himself, said-- ""We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute. Every minute is valuable. Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly. Musgrove, either you or I must go.""","L'un de nous doit partir immediatement. Musgrove, est-ce vous ou moi ? >>",1225,aligned
"Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away. He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville; but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.",Charles repondit qu'il ne pouvait supporter l'idee de quitter Louisa.,1226,aligned
"So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same. She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.","Henriette voulait aussi rester, mais elle fut forcee de reconnaitre qu'elle ne serait utile a rien, elle qui s'etait trouvee mal envoyant l'accident de sa soeur.",1227,aligned
"Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such another. Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by day or night. And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.",(No direct equivalent in text),1228,not aligned
"When the plan was made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it. She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta's stead!","Quand Marie sut ce qu'on avait decide, elle se recria. Elle se plaignit avec amertume de l'injustice qui lui faisait preferer Anna : elle, la soeur de Louisa. Pourquoi ne serait-elle pas aussi utile qu'Anna ! et la laisser retourner sans son mari !",1229,aligned
"Once only, when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as if wholly overcome-- ""Don't talk of it, don't talk of it,"" he cried.","Une fois seulement, comme elle deplorait la malencontreuse promenade sur le Cobb, il ne put se contenir, et s'ecria : << Ne parlez pas de cela, de grace, Ah !",1230,aligned

"They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence.","Mais si Louisa guerissait, le bonheur reparaitrait ici plus grand qu'avant.",1233,aligned
"She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.","Excepte les enfants de sa soeur, elle etait seule a Uppercross.",1234,aligned

"Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them. On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise of the others. Charles and Mary also came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children on his knees, generally in vain.","'Mme Musgrove, entouree des petits Harville, les protegeait contre la tyrannie des enfants du cottage. D'un cote on voyait une table occupee par les jeunes filles babillardes, decoupant des papiers d'or et de soie ; d'un autre, des plateaux charges de patisseries auxquelles les joyeux garcons faisaient fete. Un brillant feu de Noel faisait entendre son petillement en depit du bruit. Charles et Marie etaient la aussi ; M.

"Lady Russell could not help laughing. ""Upon my word,"" said she, ""I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may call myself.

"With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries, there was voluntary communication sufficient. His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected. As Louisa improved, he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week. He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger. He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.","'Anna n'osa faire de questions sur Wenvorth, mais elle sut qu'il etait moins inquiet a mesure que Louisa se remettait.

A partir de ce moment, lady Russel et Anna penserent souvent a Benwick.'",1393,aligned
"There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time. Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him. Captain Benwick came not, however. He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.","'Lady Russel ne pouvait entendre sonner sans croire aussitot que c'etait lui, et Anna, chaque fois qu'elle sortait, se demandait en rentrant si elle allait le trouver a la maison.

"""He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying: a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride, she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.""","""Il regardait en parlant ainsi le siege que Mme Clay avait occupe. ~~~ C'etait un commentaire suffisant ; Anna fut contente de voir qu'il n'aimait pas Mme Clay, et elle le trouva plus qu'excusable, en faveur du but qu'il poursuivait, de chercher de hautes relations a son pere.""",1609,aligned

"She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for the present a cripple.",Elle eut des ennuis de toute espece. ~~~ Une fievre rhumatismale qui attaqua enfin les jambes la rendit infirme.,1613,aligned
"She had come to Bath on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.","Elle etait venue a Bath pour se guerir et demeurait pres des bains chauds, vivant tres modestement, sans domestique, et par consequent exclue de la societe.",1614,aligned
"Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation.","Anna trouva dans Mme Shmith le bon sens et les manieres agreables auxquels elle s'attendait, et une disposition a la causerie et a la gaite au dela de son attente.",1615,aligned
"but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times.",Mais le premier malaise de leur rencontre fit bientot place au charme des vieux souvenirs.,1616,aligned
"and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour;","et douze ans avaient transforme la belle et fiere miss Hamilton en une pauvre veuve infirme, recevant comme une faveur la visite de son ancienne protegee.",1617,aligned
"Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;","Anna n'etait plus la silencieuse, timide et rougissante jeune fille de quinze ans, mais une elegante jeune femme, ayant toutes les beautes, excepte la fraicheur, aux manieres aussi agreables que parfaites ;",1618,aligned

"She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.","et consulta seulement lady Russel, qui l'approuva et la conduisit dans sa voiture pres du logement de Mme Shmith.",1620,aligned
"She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she intended, at home. It would excite no proper interest there.","elle ne dit rien chez elle,",1621,aligned
"Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in going.","Anna, sachant par une amie commune que sa visite serait agreable, ne perdit pas de temps : elle ne dit rien chez elle, et consulta seulement lady Russel, qui l'approuva et la conduisit dans sa voiture pres du logement de Mme Shmith.",1622,aligned
"Twelve years were gone since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined.","douze ans s'etaient ecoules, et elles se trouvaient mutuellement changees.",1623,aligned
"The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other more than re-kindled.",Les deux anciennes amies renouvelerent connaissance.,1624,aligned
"Neither the dissipations of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits.","Ni les plaisirs du monde ou elle avait beaucoup vecu, ni la condition presente, pas plus que la maladie ou le chagrin, n'avaient ferme son coeur, ni eteint sa gaite.",1625,aligned
"In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and Anne's astonishment increased.","A la seconde visite, elle causa tres librement, et l'etonnement d'Anna redoubla.",1626,aligned
She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.,Elle ne pouvait guere imaginer une situation plus triste que celle de son amie.,1627,aligned
"She had been very fond of her husband: she had buried him. ~~~ She had been used to affluence: it was gone. ~~~ She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.","Elle avait perdu un mari qu'elle adorait, une fortune a laquelle elle etait accoutumee ; elle n'avait pas d'enfants pour la rattacher a la vie et au bonheur ; aucun parent pour l'aider dans des affaires embarrassees ; pas meme de sante pour supporter tout le reste.",1628,aligned
"Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.","Elle s'accommodait d'un parloir bruyant, et d'une chambre obscure par derriere ; elle ne pouvait bouger sans l'aide de l'unique servante de l'hotel, et elle ne sortait que pour etre portee aux bains chauds.",1629,aligned
"Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.","En depit de tout cela, Anna avait lieu de croire que son amie n'avait que des minutes de langueur et d'accablement, contre des heures d'activite et de distraction.",1630,aligned

"Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.","Et cela parmi des etrangers, sans pouvoir se passer d'une garde, et dans une situation pecuniaire tres genee.",1633,aligned
"She had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her good.",Elle avait subi toutes ces choses et disait qu'il en etait resulte un bien.,1634,aligned
It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.,Elle s'etait sentie en bonnes mains.,1635,aligned
"She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill;","Elle connaissait trop le monde pour attendre un attachement soudain et desinteresse ; mais sa proprietaire s'etait montree tres bonne,",1636,aligned
"and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.","et la soeur de cette dame, garde-malade et alors sans emploi, l'avait admirablement soignee, et avait ete pour elle une amie precieuse.",1637,aligned
"""And she,"" said Mrs Smith, ""besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.","<< Aussitot que je pus faire usage de mes mains, elle me montra a tricoter, ce qui me fut une grande distraction, et a faire ces paniers, ces pelotes et ces porte-cartes avec lesquels vous me trouvez si occupee.",1638,aligned
"As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.",Ils me fournissent les moyens de faire un peu de bien a quelques pauvres familles du voisinage. >>,1639,aligned

"She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.","C'est une femme habile, sensee et intelligente, qui comprend la nature humaine.",1642,aligned

"A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.","Une ame soumise peut etre patiente ; une forte intelligence peut etre courageuse ; mais il y avait la quelque chose de plus : cette elasticite d'esprit. Cette disposition a etre consolee, cette faculte de trouver des occupations qui la detachaient d'elle-meme : tout cela venait de sa seule nature.",1644,aligned

"Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that makes one know one's species better.","Appelez cela commerage, si vous voulez ; mais quand la garde Rock a une demi-heure de loisir a me donner, je suis sure qu'elle me dira quelque chose d'amusant et d'utile, quelque chose qui nous fait mieux connaitre nos semblables.",1649,aligned

"Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.","Par-ci par-la la nature humaine peut etre grande en temps d'epreuves, mais en general c'est sa faiblesse et non sa force qui se montre dans une chambre de malade. ~~~ On y entend parler d'egoisme et d'impatience plus que de generosite et de courage.",1660,aligned

""No!"" ~~~ he replied impressively, ""there is nothing worth my staying for;"" and he was gone directly.","<< Cette chanson ne merite-t-elle pas qu'on reste ? dit Anna soudainement poussee a encourager Wenvorth. -- Non, dit-il d'un ton singulier. ~~~ Rien ici n'est digne de me retenir. >> Et il partit.",2118,aligned
"Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance improved, and he replied again with almost a smile. They talked for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round. It came from Mr Elliot. ~~~ He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain Italian again. Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung. Anne could not refuse; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit. A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell. ""He must wish her good night; he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.""","Mais elle defendit si bien les chanteurs, tout en tenant compte, d'une maniere charmante, de l'opinion du capitaine qu'il repondit par un sourire et que sa figure s'eclaircit. Alors il parut plus a l'aise, et jeta meme un regard sur le banc pour y prendre place a cote d'Anna. A ce moment elle se sentit toucher l'epaule ; c'etait M. Elliot qui la priait de vouloir bien expliquer encore l'italien. Miss Carteret desirait comprendre ce qu'on allait chanter. Anna ne put refuser, mais jamais elle n'avait fait a la politesse un plus grand sacrifice. Quand elle se retourna vers le capitaine, il lui dit adieu precipitamment.",2119,aligned
"To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation. She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without the interchange of one friendly look. In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which was favourable for her. Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals, and a little scheming of her own, Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much more within reach of a passer-by. She could not do so, without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but still she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed. Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth was again in sight. She saw him not far off. ~~~ He saw her too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her. She felt that something must be the matter. ~~~ The change was indubitable. The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great. ~~~ Why was it? She thought of her father, of Lady Russell. Could there have been any unpleasant glances? ~~~ He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.","Elle etait fort agitee, et ne pouvait etre tranquille tant qu'elle n'aurait pas echange avec lui un regard ami. Elle se placa a dessein a l'extremite d'une banquette, avec une place vide aupres d'elle. Bientot Wenvorth s'approcha, mais avec hesitation ; il avait un air grave ; le changement etait frappant. Elle pensa que son pere ou lady Russel l'avait peut-etre blesse... Il parla du concert, dit qu'il esperait de meilleur chant et qu'il ne serait pas fache d'en voir la fin.",2120,aligned
"Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move. She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean, whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity. She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him. ~~~ He did not come however. Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance, but he never came. The anxious interval wore away unproductively. ~~~ The others returned, the room filled again, benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.","La premiere partie du concert etant finie, quelques personnes proposerent d'aller prendre du the. Anna resta assise a cote de lady Russel, et fut debarrassee de M. Elliot. Elle etait decidee a parler a Wenvorth si le hasard l'amenait aupres d'elle, malgre la presence de lady Russel, qui l'avait certainement apercu.

She was a fine woman, had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her birth. All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself. Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it. His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt.'","-- Oui, c'etait la mon objection, mais il ne voulut rien entendre.

"As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret that she had said so much, simple as it was. Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin, began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to be cool and unconcerned.","Bah, repondit Charles ; qu'est-ce que c'est qu'une soiree ?

"And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.

"The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment. It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again. Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed. He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.","Elle sentit que Wenvorth la regardait, ce qui la vexa et l'embarrassa et lui fit regretter ce qu'elle avait dit.

"A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected. A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene. One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.","<< Anna, s'ecria Marie, voici Mme Clay debout sous la colonnade avec un monsieur pres d'elle.

"It was a heartiness, and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad want of such blessings at home. She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts; from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.","Il sembla a Anna qu'il etait dans la meme disposition d'esprit que le jour du concert, et qu'il voulait l'eviter.

"They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and Anne had the kindest welcome from each. Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress.","Une nombreuse compagnie arrivant dans un hotel y porte beaucoup de bruit et de mouvement ; et Anna n'avait pas ete la une demi-heure, que la vaste salle etait a moitie remplie de boites et de paquets ; puis vinrent les amies de Mme Musgrove, et, bientot apres, Harville et Wenvorth.",2499,aligned

He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return. He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow. He was full of 'to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head.""",CHAPITRE XXIII,2564,aligned
