"Persuasion by Jane Austen (1818) Chapter 1 Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.","CHAPITRE PREMIER Sir Walter Elliot, de Kellynch-Hall, dans le comte de Somerset, n'avait jamais touche un livre pour son propre amusement, si ce n'est le livre heraldique.",0,aligned

"He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.","A ses yeux, la beaute n'etait inferieure qu'a la noblesse, et le Sir Walter Elliot, qui reunissait tous ces dons, etait l'objet constant de son propre respect et de sa veneration. ~~~ Il dut a sa belle figure et a sa noblesse d'epouser une femme tres superieure a lui.",10,not aligned
His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.,"Lady Elliot avait ete une excellente femme, sensee et aimable, dont le jugement et la raison ne la tromperent jamais, si ce n'est en s'eprenant de Sir Walter.",11,not aligned
"Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.","Elle supporta, cacha ou deguisa ses defauts, et pendant dix-sept ans le fit respecter. ~~~ Elle ne fut pas tres heureuse, mais ses devoirs, ses amis, ses enfants l'attacherent assez a la vie, pour qu'elle la quittat avec regret. ~~~ Trois filles, dont les ainees avaient, l'une seize ans, l'autre quatorze, furent un terrible heritage et une lourde charge pour un pere faible et vain.",12,aligned

"That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.","Il n'est pas etonnant que lady Russel n'eut pas songe a un second mariage ; car elle possedait une belle fortune, etait d'un age mur, et d'un caractere serieux, mais le celibat de Sir Walter s'explique moins facilement.",16,aligned

"She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.","Elle se rappelait tout cela, et la conscience de ses vingt-neuf ans lui donnait des apprehensions et quelques regrets.",34,not aligned

"He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.","Apres la mort de sa femme, Sir Walter rechercha la connaissance d'Elliot. ~~~ Ses ouvertures ne furent pas recues avec empressement, mais il persevera, mettant tout sur le compte de la timidite du jeune homme.",40,aligned

"This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot's eldest daughter.","Elisabeth se rappelait cette histoire avec colere ; elle avait aime l'homme pour lui-meme et plus encore parce qu'il etait l'heritier de Sir Walter ; avec lui seul, son orgueil voyait un mariage convenable, elle le reconnaissait pour son egal.",50,aligned

"The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.",,53,not aligned

"While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.","Tant qu'avait vecu lady Elliot, l'ordre, la moderation et l'economie avaient contenu les depenses dans les limites des revenus ; mais cet equilibre avait disparu avec elle : les dettes augmentaient ; elles etaient connues, et il devenait impossible de les cacher entierement a Elisabeth.",59,aligned
"It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.","L'hiver dernier, Sir Walter avait propose deja quelques diminutions dans les depenses, et, pour rendre justice a Elisabeth, elle avait indique deux reformes : supprimer quelques charites inutiles, et ne point renouveler l'ameublement du salon.",60,not aligned

"Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.","Il contenait seulement deux maisons superieures d'apparence a celles des fermiers et des laboureurs : celle du squire avec ses hauts murs, ses portes massives et ses vieux arbres, solide et antique ; et la cure, compacte, ramassee, enfermee dans un jardin bien soigne, avec une vigne et des poiriers palissant les murs. ~~~ Mais, au mariage du jeune squire, la ferme avait ete changee en cottage pour sa residence ; et le Cottage Uppercross, avec sa veranda, ses fenetres francaises, et ses autres agrements, attirait l'oeil du voyageur a un quart de mille, aussi bien que l'imposante Great-House avec ses dependances.",335,aligned

"Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation, or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.","Cependant Anna et lady Russel pensaient qu'une femme intelligente aurait pu donner a son caractere plus de suite, a ses habitudes plus d'elegance, a ses occupations plus d'utilite et de sens pratique.",435,aligned
"As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.","Il ne mettait beaucoup d'ardeur a rien, si ce n'est au jeu, et il gaspillait son temps.",436,aligned
"He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple.","Il etait d'un caractere gai, s'affectant peu des doleances de sa femme ; il supportait son manque de bon sens avec une patience qui emerveillait Anna, et en definitive, malgre quelques petites querelles (ou les deux parties appelaient Anna, a son grand regret), ce couple pouvait passer pour heureux.",437,aligned
"They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.","Il y avait une chose sur laquelle ils etaient toujours parfaitement d'accord : le besoin d'argent et le desir de recevoir un cadeau de M.

"""I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary's interference,"" was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of ""Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,"" she never had the smallest temptation to say, ""Very true.""","Mais quand Marie repondait a cela : << Charles gate tellement les enfants que je ne puis en venir a bout, >> Anna n'etait jamais tentee de dire que c'etait vrai.",440,aligned

"And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, ""I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.",">> Et Mme Musgrove : << Je me fais une loi de ne jamais me meler des affaires de ma belle-fille, mais je vous dirai, miss Anna, (parce que vous pouvez y remedier), que je n'ai pas bonne opinion de sa femme de chambre, j'entends d'etranges histoires.",459,not aligned

"Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.","Marie ne voit que par ses yeux ; mais je vous avertis : soyez sur vos gardes, parce que, si vous decouvrez quelque chose, il ne faut pas craindre de le dire. ~~~ >> Marie se plaignait aussi de n'avoir pas a table la place qui lui etait due.",461,aligned
"And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, ""I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.","Quand, a Great-House, il y avait d'autres invites, on la placait comme si elle etait de la maison. ~~~ Un jour qu'Anna se promenait avec les misses Musgrove, l'une d'elles, parlant de noblesse et de susceptibilites de rang, dit : << Je n'ai aucun scrupule a vous dire, parce qu'on sait que vous y etes indifferente, combien quelques personnes sont absurdes pour garder leur rang.",462,not aligned
"Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.","Cependant je voudrais qu'on put faire comprendre a Marie qu'elle ne devrait pas etre si tenace, et surtout ne pas se mettre toujours a la place de ma mere.",463,aligned

"In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.",>> Comment Anna aurait-elle pu concilier tout le monde ?,467,not aligned
"Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.","Elle ne pouvait qu'ecouter patiemment, apaiser les griefs ; excuser l'un, puis l'autre ; les engager a l'indulgence necessaire entre voisins, surtout quand il s'agissait de sa soeur. ~~~ Sa visite eut du reste un bon resultat ; le changement de place lui fit du bien, et Marie, ayant une compagne assidue, se plaignit moins.",468,not aligned
"It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.","Les relations quotidiennes avec l'autre famille etaient tres agreables, mais Anna pensait que tout n'aurait pas ete si bien sans la presence de M. et de Mme Musgrove, ou les rires, les causeries et les chansons des jeunes filles.",469,aligned
"She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware.","Elle etait meilleure musicienne que celles-ci ; mais, n'ayant ni voix, ni connaissance de la harpe, ni parents indulgents pour s'extasier sur son jeu, on ne pensait guere a lui demander de jouer, sinon par simple politesse, ou pour laisser reposer les autres.",470,aligned

"In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own.","Elle y etait accoutumee, et la partialite de M. et Mme Musgrove pour leurs filles, loin de la vexer, lui faisait plutot plaisir, a cause de l'amitie qu'elle leur portait.",473,not aligned
The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.,Quelques personnes augmentaient parfois le cercle de Great-House.,474,aligned
"The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.","Il y avait peu de voisins, mais les Musgrove voyaient tout le monde, et avaient plus de diners et de visites qu'aucune autre famille.",475,aligned

"There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--""Well done, Miss Anne! ~~~ very well done indeed!","A quelques minutes d'Uppercross habitait une famille de cousins, moins riches, qui recevaient tous leurs plaisirs des Musgrove. ~~~ Ils venaient n'importe quand, organisaient un jeu ou un bal a l'improviste, et Anna, qui preferait a un role plus actif s'asseoir au piano, leur jouait des danses de village pendant une heure de suite, obligeance qui attirait sur son talent musical l'attention des Musgrove, et lui valait souvent ce compliment : << Tres bien, miss Anna, tres bien, vraiment.",478,aligned

"She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.","Elle avait de brillants yeux noirs, de belles dents et une figure agreable ; mais son teint hale et rougi par la vie sur mer lui donnait quelques annees de plus que ses trente-huit ans.",495,aligned

"He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money.","Il avait ete plusieurs annees en mer, et dans le cours de ces changements frequents pour les mousses dont le capitaine desire se debarrasser, il avait ete six mois sur la fregate Laconia, commandee par le capitaine Frederic Wenvorth, et sous l'influence de ce dernier, il avait ecrit a ses parents les deux seules lettres desinteressees qu'ils eussent jamais recues de lui ; les autres n'etaient que des demandes d'argent.",518,aligned
"In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.","Il disait toujours du bien de son capitaine, mais ses parents s'en souciaient si peu qu'ils n'y avaient fait aucune attention, et si Mme Musgrove fut frappee par le nom de Wenvorth associe avec celui de son fils, c'etait par un de ces phenomenes de la memoire assez frequents chez les personnes distraites.",519,aligned
"She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death.","Elle avait relu les lettres de ce fils perdu pour toujours, et cette lecture, apres un si long intervalle, alors que les fautes etaient oubliees, l'avait affectee plus profondement que la nouvelle de sa mort.",520,aligned
"Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.","M. Musgrove l'etait aussi, mais a un moindre degre, et en arrivant au cottage ils avaient besoin d'etre ecoutes et egayes.",521,aligned
"To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves. ~~~ She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.","Ce fut une nouvelle epreuve pour Anna d'entendre parler de Wenvorth, et repeter son nom si souvent, d'entendre disputer sur les dates, et affirmer enfin que ce ne pouvait etre que le capitaine Wenvorth, ce beau jeune homme qu'on avait rencontre plusieurs fois en revenant de Clifton huit annees auparavant.",522,aligned
"Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points.","Elle vit qu'il fallait s'accoutumer a ce supplice, et tacher de devenir insensible a cette arrivee.",523,not aligned
"And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as ""a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,"" were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival.","Non seulement il etait attendu prochainement, mais les Musgrove, reconnaissants des bontes qu'il avait eues pour leur fils, et pleins de respect pour le caractere que Dick leur avait depeint, desiraient vivement faire sa connaissance.",524,not aligned

"She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the interference in any plan of their own.","Elle tacha de dissuader Marie d'y aller ; mais, n'y reussissant pas, elle pensa qu'il valait mieux accepter aussi, pour elle-meme, l'invitation beaucoup plus cordiale des misses Musgrove, car sa presence pouvait etre utile pour retourner avec sa soeur et ne pas entraver leurs plans.",927,aligned

"He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their conversation.","Anna lui demanda s'il faisait de la poesie sa lecture habituelle ; elle esperait que non, car le sort des poetes est d'etre malheureux, et il n'est pas donne a ceux qui eprouvent des sentiments vifs d'en gouter les jouissances dans la vie reelle.",1127,not aligned
"For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.",,1128,not aligned
