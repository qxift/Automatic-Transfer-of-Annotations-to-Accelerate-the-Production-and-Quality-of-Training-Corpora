Persuasion by Jane Austen (1818) Chapter 1 Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.	CHAPITRE PREMIER Sir Walter Elliot, de Kellynch-Hall, dans le comte de Somerset, n'avait jamais touche un livre pour son propre amusement, si ce n'est le livre heraldique.	-0.122114
This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened: "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL."	La il trouvait de l'occupation dans les heures de desoeuvrement, et de la consolation dans les heures de chagrin.	0.221053
"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq.	Devant ces vieux parchemins, il eprouvait un sentiment de respect et d'admiration.	0.225
of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."	La, toutes les sensations desagreables provenant des affaires domestiques se changeaient en pitie et en mepris.	0.0618557
Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth-- "Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq.	Quand il feuilletait les innombrables titres crees dans le siecle dernier, si chaque feuille lui etait indifferente, une seule avait constamment pour lui le meme interet, c'etait la page ou le volume favori s'ouvrait toujours : Famille Elliot, de Kellynch-Hall : Walter Elliot, ne le 1er mars 1760 ; epousa, le 15 juillet 1784, Elisabeth, fille de Jacques Stevenson, esquire de South-Park, comte de Glocester, laquelle mourut en 1800.	0.207541
of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset," and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife.	Il en eut : Elisabeth, nee le 1er juin 1785, Anna, nee le 9 aoust 1787, Un fils mort-ne le 5 novembre 1789, et Marie, nee le 20 novembre 1791.	0.274286
Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto:--"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset," and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:-- "Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the second Sir Walter."	Tel etait le paragraphe sorti des mains de l'imprimeur ; mais Sir Walter y avait ajoute pour sa propre instruction, et pour celle de sa famille, a la suite de la date de naissance de Marie : << Mariee le 16 decembre 1810 a Charles Musgrove, esquire d'Uppercross, comte de Somerset. ~~~ >> Puis venait l'histoire de l'ancienne et respectable famille : le premier de ses membres s'etablissant dans Cheshire, exercant la fonction de haut sherif ; representant un bourg dans trois parlements successifs, et cree baronnet dans la premiere annee du regne de Charles II. ~~~ Le livre mentionnait aussi les femmes ; le tout formant deux pages in-folio, accompagne des armoiries et termine par l'indication suivante : << Residence principale : Kellynch-Hall, comte de Somerset.	-0.0782051
Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation.	>> Puis, de la main de Sir Walter : << Heritier presomptif : William Walter Elliot, esquire, arriere-petit-fils du second Sir Walter.	0.534891
He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.	>> La vanite etait le commencement et la fin du caractere de Sir Elliot : vanite personnelle, et vanite de rang.	0.237662
Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society.	Il avait ete remarquablement beau dans sa jeunesse, et a cinquante-quatre ans, etant tres bien conserve, il avait plus de pretentions a la beaute que bien des femmes, et il etait plus satisfait de sa place dans la societe que le valet d'un lord de fraiche date.	0.394032
He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.	A ses yeux, la beaute n'etait inferieure qu'a la noblesse, et le Sir Walter Elliot, qui reunissait tous ces dons, etait l'objet constant de son propre respect et de sa veneration. ~~~ Il dut a sa belle figure et a sa noblesse d'epouser une femme tres superieure a lui.	0.219375
His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.	Lady Elliot avait ete une excellente femme, sensee et aimable, dont le jugement et la raison ne la tromperent jamais, si ce n'est en s'eprenant de Sir Walter.	0.295455
Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.	Elle supporta, cacha ou deguisa ses defauts, et pendant dix-sept ans le fit respecter. ~~~ Elle ne fut pas tres heureuse, mais ses devoirs, ses amis, ses enfants l'attacherent assez a la vie, pour qu'elle la quittat avec regret. ~~~ Trois filles, dont les ainees avaient, l'une seize ans, l'autre quatorze, furent un terrible heritage et une lourde charge pour un pere faible et vain.	-0.218916
She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters.	Mais elle avait une amie, femme sensee et respectable, qui s'etait decidee, par attachement pour elle, a habiter tout pres, au village de Kellynch. ~~~ Lady Elliot se reposa sur elle pour maintenir les bons principes qu'elle avait tache de donner a ses filles.	0.060553
This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.	Cette amie n'epousa pas Sir Walter, quoique leur connaissance eut pu le faire supposer.	0.604
Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow.	Treize annees s'etaient ecoulees depuis la mort de lady Elliot, et ils restaient proches voisins et amis intimes, mais rien de plus.	0.233036
That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.	Il n'est pas etonnant que lady Russel n'eut pas songe a un second mariage ; car elle possedait une belle fortune, etait d'un age mur, et d'un caractere serieux, mais le celibat de Sir Walter s'explique moins facilement.	0.455233
Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.	La verite est qu'il avait essuye plusieurs refus a des demandes en mariage tres deraisonnables. ~~~ Des lors, il se posa comme un bon pere qui se devoue pour ses filles.	-0.0399281
For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not been very much tempted to do.	En realite, pour l'ainee seule, il etait dispose a faire quelque chose, mais a condition de ne pas se gener.	0.28
Elizabeth had succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily.	Elisabeth, a seize ans, avait succede a tous les droits et a la consideration de sa mere. ~~~ Elle etait fort belle et ressemblait a son pere, sur qui elle avait une grande influence ; aussi avaient-ils toujours ete d'accord.	-0.00725806
His two other children were of very inferior value.	Les deux autres filles de Sir Walter etaient, a son avis, d'une valeur inferieure.	0.122727
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--she was only Anne.	Marie avait acquis une legere importance en devenant Mme Musgrove ; mais Anna, avec une distinction d'esprit et une douceur de caractere que toute personne intelligente savait apprecier, n'etait rien pour son pere, ni pour sa soeur.	0.164467
To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite, and friend.	On ne faisait aucun cas de ce qu'elle disait, et elle devait toujours s'effacer ; enfin elle n'etait qu'Anna.	0.275294
Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.	Lady Russel aimait ses soeurs, mais dans Anna seulement elle voyait revivre son amie.	0.458904
A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.	Quelques annees auparavant, Anna etait une tres jolie fille, mais sa fraicheur disparut vite, et son pere, qui ne l'admirait guere quand elle etait dans tout son eclat, car ses traits delicats et ses doux yeux bruns etaient trop differents des siens, ne trouvait plus rien en elle qui put exciter son estime, maintenant qu'elle etait fanee et amincie.	0.279273
He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.	Il n'avait jamais espere voir le nom d'Anna sur une autre page de son livre favori.	0.367775
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.	Toute alliance egale reposait sur Elisabeth, car Marie, entree dans une notable et riche famille de province, lui avait fait plus d'honneur qu'elle n'en avait recu. ~~~ Un jour ou l'autre, Elisabeth se marierait selon son rang.	-0.0235602
It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost.	Il arrive parfois qu'une femme est plus belle a vingt-neuf ans que dix ans plus tot. ~~~ Quand elle n'a eu ni chagrins, ni maladies, c'est souvent une epoque de la vie ou la beaute n'a rien perdu de ses charmes.	-0.0131579
It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing.	Chez Elisabeth, il en etait ainsi : c'etait toujours la belle miss Elliot, et Sir Elliot etait a moitie excusable d'oublier l'age de sa fille, et de se croire lui-meme aussi jeune qu'autrefois au milieu des ruines qui l'entouraient.	0.298846
Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.	Il voyait avec chagrin Anna se faner, Marie grossir, ses voisins vieillir et les rides se creuser rapidement autour des yeux de lady Russel.	0.231356
Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.	Elisabeth n'etait pas aussi satisfaite que son pere.	0.228261
Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was.	Depuis treize ans, elle etait maitresse de Kellynch-Hall, presidant et dirigeant avec une assurance et une decision qui ne la rajeunissaient pas.	0.351235
For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.	Pendant treize ans, elle avait fait les honneurs du logis, etablissant les lois domestiques, assise dans le landau a la place d'honneur, et ayant le pas immediatement apres lady Russel dans tous les salons et a tous les diners.	0.282632
Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.	Treize hivers l'avaient vue ouvrir chaque bal de ceremonie donne dans le voisinage, et les fleurs de treize printemps avaient fleuri depuis qu'elle allait, avec son pere, jouir des plaisirs de Londres pendant quelques semaines.	0.26134
She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.	Elle se rappelait tout cela, et la conscience de ses vingt-neuf ans lui donnait des apprehensions et quelques regrets.	-0.320792
Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not.	Elle se savait aussi belle que jamais, mais elle sentait s'approcher les annees dangereuses, et aurait voulu etre demandee par quelque baronnet avant la fin de l'annee.	0.148421
Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away.	Elle aurait pu alors feuilleter le livre par excellence avec autant de joie qu'autrefois ; mais voir toujours la date de sa naissance, et pas d'autre mariage que celui de sa jeune soeur, lui rendait le livre odieux ; et plus d'une fois, le voyant ouvert, elle le repoussa en detournant les yeux.	0.316667
She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.	D'ailleurs elle avait eu une deception que ce livre lui rappelait toujours.	0.0507692
The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her.	L'heritier presomptif, ce meme William Walter Elliot dont les droits avaient ete si genereusement reconnus par son pere, avait refuse sa main.	0.56087
She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.	Quand elle etait toute petite fille, et qu'elle esperait n'avoir point de frere, elle avait songe deja a epouser William, et c'etait aussi l'intention de son pere.	0.361491
He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.	Apres la mort de sa femme, Sir Walter rechercha la connaissance d'Elliot. ~~~ Ses ouvertures ne furent pas recues avec empressement, mais il persevera, mettant tout sur le compte de la timidite du jeune homme.	-0.133714
He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed.	Dans un de leurs voyages a Londres, Elisabeth etait alors dans tout l'eclat de sa beaute et de sa fraicheur, William ne put refuser une invitation.	0.381843
He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.	C'etait alors un jeune etudiant en droit, Elisabeth le trouva extremement agreable et se confirma dans ses projets.	0.258621
The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married.	Il fut invite a Kellynch. ~~~ On en parla et on l'attendit jusqu'au bout de l'annee, mais il ne vint pas.	-0.127059
Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth.	Le printemps suivant, on le revit a Londres. ~~~ Les memes avances lui furent faites, mais en vain.	-0.113415
Sir Walter had resented it.	Enfin on apprit qu'il etait marie.	0.225
	Au lieu de chercher fortune dans la voie tracee a l'heritier de Sir Walter, il avait achete l'independance en epousant une femme riche, de naissance inferieure.	-0.3
As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; "For they must have been seen together," he observed, "once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons."	Sir Walter fut irrite ; il aurait voulu etre consulte, comme chef de famille, surtout apres avoir fait si publiquement des avances au jeune homme ; car on les avait vus ensemble au Tattersall et a la Chambre des Communes.	0.24918
His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded.	Il exprima son mecontentement.	-0.075
Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it: all acquaintance between them had ceased.	Mais M. Elliot n'y fit guere attention, et meme n'essaya point de s'excuser ; il se montra aussi peu desireux d'etre compte dans la famille que Sir Walter l'en jugeait indigne, et toute relation cessa.	0.567273
This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot's eldest daughter.	Elisabeth se rappelait cette histoire avec colere ; elle avait aime l'homme pour lui-meme et plus encore parce qu'il etait l'heritier de Sir Walter ; avec lui seul, son orgueil voyait un mariage convenable, elle le reconnaissait pour son egal.	0.380488
There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.	Cependant il s'etait si mal conduit, qu'il meritait d'etre oublie.	0.160345
Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.	On aurait pu lui pardonner son mariage, car on ne lui supposait pas d'enfants, mais il avait parle legerement et meme avec mepris de la famille Elliot et des honneurs qui devaient etre les siens.	0.298137
The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.		-0.3
This could not be pardoned.	On ne pouvait lui pardonner cela.	0.2375
Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.	Telles etaient les pensees d'Elisabeth ; telles etaient les preoccupations et les agitations destinees a varier la monotonie de sa vie elegante, oisive et somptueuse, et a remplir les vides qu'aucune habitude utile au dehors, aucuns talents a l'interieur ne venaient occuper.	0.37909
But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these. ~~~ Her father was growing distressed for money.	Mais bientot d'autres preoccupations s'ajouterent a celles-la : son pere avait des embarras d'argent.	-0.0328767
She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.	Elle savait qu'il etait venu habiter la baronnie pour payer ses lourdes dettes, et pour mettre fin aux insinuations desagreables de son homme d'affaires, M. Shepherd.	0.297887
The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required in its possessor.	Le domaine de Kellynch etait bon, mais insuffisant pour la representation que Sir Walter jugeait necessaire.	0.643367
While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.	Tant qu'avait vecu lady Elliot, l'ordre, la moderation et l'economie avaient contenu les depenses dans les limites des revenus ; mais cet equilibre avait disparu avec elle : les dettes augmentaient ; elles etaient connues, et il devenait impossible de les cacher entierement a Elisabeth.	0.208556
It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.	L'hiver dernier, Sir Walter avait propose deja quelques diminutions dans les depenses, et, pour rendre justice a Elisabeth, elle avait indique deux reformes : supprimer quelques charites inutiles, et ne point renouveler l'ameublement du salon.	0.396667
He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?		-0.3
Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?"	Elle eut aussi l'heureuse idee de ne plus donner d'etrennes a Anna.	0.268421
and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.		-0.3
But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.	Mais ces mesures etaient insuffisantes ; Sir Walter fut oblige de le confesser, et Elisabeth ne trouva pas d'autre remede plus efficace.	0.457421
Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy.	Comme lui, elle se trouvait malheureuse et maltraitee par le sort.	0.228261
She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.		-0.3
There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.	Sir Walter ne pouvait disposer que d'une petite partie de son domaine, et encore etait-elle hypothequee.	0.556275
He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell.		-0.3
No; he would never disgrace his name so far.	Jamais il n'aurait voulu vendre, se deshonorer a ce point.	0.194595
The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire, as he had received it.	Le domaine de Kellynch devait etre transmis intact a ses heritiers.	0.487931
Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride.	Les deux amis intimes, M. Shepherd et lady Russel, furent appeles a donner un conseil ; ils devaient trouver quelque expedient pour reduire les depenses sans faire souffrir Sir Walter et sa fille dans leur orgueil ou dans leurs fantaisies. ~~~ CHAPITRE II M. Shepherd etait un homme habile et prudent.	-0.0310757
Chapter 2 Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted.	Quelle que fut son opinion sur Sir Walter, il voulait laisser a un autre que lui le role desagreable ; il s'excusa, se permettant toutefois de recommander une deference absolue pour l'excellent jugement de lady Russel.	0.233461
Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it much serious consideration.	Celle-ci prit le sujet en grande consideration et y apporta un zele inquiet.	0.221538
She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.	C'etait plutot une femme de bon sens que d'imagination.	-0.33125
She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.	La difficulte a resoudre etait grande : lady Russel avait une stricte integrite et un delicat sentiment d'honneur ; mais elle souhaitait de menager les sentiments de Sir Walter et le rang de la famille.	0.370809
She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.	C'etait une personne bonne, bienveillante, charitable et capable d'une solide amitie ; tres correcte dans sa conduite, stricte dans ses idees de decorum, et un modele de savoir-vivre.	0.476323
She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them.	Son esprit etait tres pratique et cultive ; mais elle donnait au rang et a la noblesse une valeur exageree, qui la rendait aveugle aux defauts des possesseurs de ces biens.	0.27417
Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.	Veuve d'un simple chevalier, elle estimait tres haut un baronnet, et Sir Walter avait droit a sa compassion et a ses attentions, non seulement comme un vieil ami, un voisin attentif, un seigneur obligeant, mari de son amie, pere d'Anna et de ses soeurs, mais parce qu'il etait Sir Walter.	0.474118
They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt. ~~~ But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth.	Il fallait faire des reformes sans aucun doute, mais elle se tourmentait pour donner a ses amis le moins d'ennuis possible.	-0.0201923
She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing: she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question.		-0.3
She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter.	Elle traca des plans d'economie, fit d'exacts calculs, et enfin prit l'avis d'Anna, qu'on n'avait pas juge a propos de consulter, et elle subit son influence.	0.362753
Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty against importance.	Les reformes d'Anna porterent sur l'honorabilite aux depens de l'ostentation.	0.291045
She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.

"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Lady Russell, looking over her paper, "much may be done.	<< Si nous pouvons persuader tout cela a votre pere, dit lady Russel en relisant ses notes, ce sera beaucoup.	0.293258
If he will adopt these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.	S'il adopte ces reformes, dans sept ans il sera libere, et j'espere le convaincre que sa consideration n'en sera pas ebranlee, et que sa vraie dignite sera loin d'en etre amoindrie aux yeux des gens raisonnables.	0.094382
What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have done, or ought to do?	<< En realite, que fera-t-il, si ce n'est ce que beaucoup de nos premieres familles ont fait, ou devraient faire ?	0.24375
There will be nothing singular in his case; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as it always does of our conduct.		-0.3
I have great hope of prevailing. ~~~ We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father, there is still more due to the character of an honest man."		-0.3
This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him.	Il n'y aura rien la de singulier, et c'est de la singularite que nous souffrons le plus.	0.250685
She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.	Apres tout, celui qui a fait des dettes doit les payer ; et tout en faisant la part des idees d'un gentilhomme, le caractere d'honnete homme passe avant tout.	0.192366
She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.	>> C'etait d'apres ce principe qu'Anna voulait voir son pere agir.	0.192857
She rated Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.	Elle considerait comme un devoir indispensable de satisfaire les creanciers en faisant rapidement toutes les reformes possibles, et ne voyait aucune dignite en dehors de cela.	0.208609
Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.	Elle comptait sur l'influence de lady Russel pour persuader une reforme complete ; elle savait que le sacrifice de deux chevaux ne serait guere moins penible que celui de quatre, ainsi que toutes les legeres reductions proposees par son amie.	0.340562
How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence. ~~~ Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up with, were not to be borne.

"Quit Kellynch Hall."	Quitter Kellynch !	0.997059
The hint was immediately taken up by Mr Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode.	L'idee fut aussitot saisie par Shepherd, qui avait un interet aux reformes de Sir Walter, et qui etait persuade qu'on ne pouvait rien faire sans un changement de residence.	0.44
"Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple," he said, "in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.	Puisque l'idee en etait venue, il n'eut aucun scrupule a confesser qu'il etait du meme avis.	0.0807692
It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.	Il ne croyait pas que Sir Walter put reellement changer sa maniere de vivre dans une maison qui avait a soutenir un tel caractere d'honorabilite et de representation.	0.608187
In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household."	Partout ailleurs il pourrait faire ce qu'il voudrait, et sa maison serait toujours prise pour modele.	0.117241
Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.	Apres quelques jours de doute et d'indecision, la grande question du changement de residence fut decidee.	0.216031
There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in the country.	On pouvait choisir Londres, Bath, ou une autre habitation aux environs de Kellynch.	0.505714
All Anne's wishes had been for the latter. ~~~ A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her ambition.	L'objet de l'ambition d'Anna eut ete de posseder une petite maison dans le voisinage de lady Russel, pres de Marie, et de voir parfois les ombrages et les prairies de Kellynch.	-0.0438776
But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.	Mais sa destinee etait d'avoir toujours l'inverse de ce qu'elle desirait.	0.182813
She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home.	Elle n'aimait pas Bath, mais Bath devait etre sa residence.	0.739572
Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.	Sir Walter penchait pour Londres, mais M. Shepherd n'en voulait pas pour lui, et il fut assez habile pour le dissuader et lui faire preferer Bath : la il pourrait comparativement faire figure a peu de frais.	0.596078
It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament: he might there be important at comparatively little expense.	Les deux avantages de Bath avaient ete pris en grande consideration : sa distance de Kellynch, seulement cinquante milles, et le sejour qu'y faisait lady Russel pendant une partie de l'hiver.	0.128155
Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight: its more convenient distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.	A la grande satisfaction de cette derniere, Sir Walter et Elisabeth en arriverent a croire qu'ils ne perdraient rien a Bath en consideration et en plaisirs.	0.192172
Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.	Lady Russel fut obligee d'aller contre les desirs de sa chere Anna.	0.544643
It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood.	C'etait en demander trop a Sir Walter que de s'etablir dans une petite maison du voisinage.	0.817723
Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's feelings they must have been dreadful.	Anna, elle-meme, y aurait trouve des mortifications plus grandes qu'elle ne le prevoyait, et pour Sir Walter, elles eussent ete terribles.	0.562292
And with regard to Anne's dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising, first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly, from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself.		-0.3
Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits good.	Lady Russel considerait l'antipathie d'Anna pour Bath comme une prevention erronee provenant de trois annees de pension passees la apres la mort de sa mere, et en second lieu de ce qu'elle n'etait pas en bonne disposition d'esprit pendant le seul hiver qu'elle y eut passe avec elle.	0.354759
Anne had been too little from home, too little seen.	Lady Russel adorait Bath et s'imaginait que tout le monde devait penser comme elle.	0.115909
Her spirits were not high. ~~~ A larger society would improve them.	Sa jeune amie pourrait passer les mois les plus chauds avec elle a Kellynch-Lodge.	-0.0375
She wanted her to be more known.	Ce changement serait bon pour sa sante et pour son esprit.	0.0555556
The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the beginning.	Anna avait trop peu vu le monde ; elle n'etait pas gaie : plus de societe lui ferait du bien.	-0.124
He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.	Puis, Sir Walter, habitant dans le voisinage de Kellynch, aurait souffert de voir sa maison aux mains d'un autre ; c'eut ete une trop rude epreuve.	0.408672
Kellynch Hall was to be let.	Il fallait louer Kellynch-Hall.	0.2375
This, however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own circle.	Mais ce fut un profond secret, renferme dans leur petit cercle.	0.466667
Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house.	Sir Walter eut ete trop humilie qu'on l'apprit.	0.703252
Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word "advertise," but never dared approach it again.	M. Shepherd avait prononce une fois le mot << avertissement >>, mais n'avait pas ose le redire.	0.48
Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour, that he would let it at all.	Sir Walter en meprisait la seule idee et defendait qu'on y fit la moindre allusion. ~~~ Il ne consentirait a louer que comme sollicite a l'imprevu, par un locataire exceptionnel, acceptant toutes ses conditions comme une grande faveur.	0.015975
How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!	Nous approuvons bien vite ce que nous aimons.	0.246154
Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country.	Lady Russel avait encore une autre raison d'etre contente du depart projete de Sir Walter.	0.530844
Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.	Elisabeth avait forme une intimite qu'il etait desirable de rompre.	0.233898
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additional burden of two children.	La fille de M. Shepherd, mal mariee, etait revenue chez son pere, avec deux enfants.	0.225528
She was a clever young woman, who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of caution and reserve.	C'etait une femme habile qui connaissait l'art de plaire, au moins a Kellynch-Hall. ~~~ Elle avait si bien su se faire accepter de miss Elliot, qu'elle y avait fait plusieurs sejours, malgre les prudentes insinuations de lady Russel, qui trouvait cette amitie deplacee.	0.0143172
Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because Elizabeth deserved it.	Lady Russel avait peu d'influence sur Elisabeth et semblait l'aimer plutot par devoir que par inclination.	0.332992
She had never received from her more than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against previous inclination.	Celle-ci n'avait pour elle que des egards et de la politesse, mais jamais lady Russel n'avait reussi a faire prevaloir ses avis ; elle etait tres peinee de voir Anna exclue si injustement des voyages a Londres et avait insiste fortement a plusieurs reprises pour qu'elle en fit partie.	0.18
She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain: Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.	Elle s'etait efforcee souvent de faire profiter Elisabeth de son jugement et de son experience, mais toujours en vain. ~~~ Miss Elliot avait sa volonte, et jamais elle n'avait fait une opposition plus decidee a lady Russel, qu'en choisissant Mme Clay et en delaissant une soeur si distinguee, pour donner son affection et sa confiance la ou il ne devait y avoir que de simples relations de politesse.	-0.090991
From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion; and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an object of first-rate importance.	Lady Russel considerait Mme Clay comme une amie dangereuse, et d'une position inferieure ; et son changement de residence, qui la laisserait de cote et permettrait a miss Elliot de choisir une intimite plus convenable, lui semblait une chose de premiere importance.	0.533736
Chapter 3 "I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, "that the present juncture is much in our favour.	CHAPITRE III << Permettez-moi de vous faire observer, Sir Walter, >> dit M. Shepherd un matin a Kellynch-Hall, en depliant le journal, << que la situation actuelle nous est tres favorable.	0.4695

Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.	Est-il un meilleur moment pour choisir de bons locataires ?	0.117647
Many a noble fortune has been made during the war.	Si un riche amiral se presentait, Sir Walter ?	0.276923
If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter--" "He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd," replied Sir Walter; "that's all I have to remark.	-- Ce serait un heureux mortel, Shepherd, >> repondit Sir Walter. ~~~ << C'est tout ce que j'ai a remarquer.	0.0710674
A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?"	En verite, Kellynch-Hall serait pour lui la plus belle de toutes les prises, n'est-ce pas, Shepherd ?	0.209302
Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added-- "I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business, gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.	>> M. Shepherd sourit, comme c'etait son devoir, a, ce jeu de mots, et ajouta : << J'ose affirmer, Sir Walter, qu'en fait d'affaires les officiers de marine sont tres accommodants.	0.573087
I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.	J'en sais quelque chose. ~~~ Ils ont des idees liberales, et ce sont les meilleurs locataires qu'on puisse voir.	-0.129255
Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the trouble of replying." ~~~ Sir Walter only nodded.	Permettez-moi donc de suggerer que si votre intention venait a etre connue, ce qui est tres possible (car il est tres difficile a Sir Walter de celer a la curiosite publique ses actions et ses desseins ; tandis que moi, John Shepherd, je puis cacher mes affaires, car personne ne perd son temps a m'observer) ; je dis donc que je ne serais pas surpris, malgre notre prudence, si quelque rumeur de la verite transpirait au dehors ; dans ce cas, des offres seront faites, et je pense que quelque riche commandant de la marine sera digne de notre attention, et permettez-moi d'ajouter que deux heures me suffisent pour accourir ici, et vous epargner la peine de repondre.	0.0288295
But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room, he observed sarcastically-- "There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description."	>> Sir Walter ne repondit que par un signe de tete ; mais bientot, se levant et arpentant la chambre, il dit ironiquement : << Il y a peu d'officiers de marine qui ne soient surpris, j'imagine, d'habiter un tel domaine.	0.381081
"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune," said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present: her father had driven her over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch: "but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant.	-- Ils beniront leur bonne fortune, >> dit Mme Clay (son pere l'avait amenee, rien n'etant si bon pour sa sante qu'une promenade a Kellynch).	0.195176
I have known a good deal of the profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful in all their ways!	<< Mais je pense, comme mon pere, qu'un marin serait un tres desirable locataire.	0.165217
These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.	J'en ai connu beaucoup. ~~~ Ils sont si scrupuleux, et si larges en affaires !	-0.0445313
Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!	Si vous leur laissez vos beaux tableaux, Sir Walter, ils seront en surete : tout sera parfaitement soigne.	0.157377
The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.	Les jardins et les massifs seront presque aussi bien entretenus qu'actuellement.	0.286765
You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected."	Ne craignez pas, miss Elliot, que vos jolies fleurs soient negligees.	0.48
"As to all that," rejoined Sir Walter coolly, "supposing I were induced to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it.	-- Quant a cela, repondit froidement Sir Walter, si je me decidais a louer, j'hesiterais a accorder certains privileges ; je ne suis pas dispose a faire des faveurs a un locataire.	0.443472
I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.	Sans doute le parc lui sera ouvert, et il n'en trouverait pas beaucoup d'aussi vastes.	0.0906977
The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds, is another thing.	<< Quant aux restrictions que je puis imposer sur la jouissance des reserves de chasse, c'est autre chose.	0.171228
I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.		-0.3
I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier."	L'idee d'en donner l'entree ne me sourit guere, et je recommanderais volontiers a miss Elliot de se tenir en garde pour ses parterres.	0.402143
After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say-- "In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.	>> Apres un court silence, M. Shepherd hasarda : << Dans ce cas, il y a des usages etablis, qui rendent chaque chose simple et facile entre proprietaire et locataire.	0.614907
Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands. ~~~ Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.	Vos interets, Sir Walter, sont en mains sures : comptez sur moi pour qu'on n'empiete pas sur vos droits.	0.153409
I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him."	Qu'on me permette de le dire : je suis plus jaloux des droits de Sir Walter, qu'il ne l'est lui-meme.	0.403098
Here Anne spoke-- "The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give.	>> Ici, Anna prit la parole. ~~~ << Il me semble que l'armee navale, qui a tant fait pour nous, a autant de droits que toute autre classe a une maison confortable.	-0.0261364

What Miss Anne says, is very true," was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and "Oh!	-- Certainement, >> ajouta sa fille.	0.01875
certainly," was his daughter's; but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards-- "The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it."	Mais bientot apres, Sir Walter fit cette remarque : << La profession a son utilite, mais je serais tres fache qu'un de mes amis lui appartint.	0.443409

First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man.	D'abord c'est un moyen pour un homme de naissance obscure d'obtenir une distinction qui ne lui est pas due, d'arriver a des honneurs que ses ancetres n'ont jamais reves ; puis elle detruit totalement la beaute et la jeunesse. ~~~ Un marin vieillit plus vite qu'un autre.	0.0382979

One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.

But then, is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?	Mais n'en est-il pas ainsi dans beaucoup d'autres professions ?	0.245455
Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.	Les soldats ne sont pas mieux traites, et meme dans les professions plus tranquilles, il y a une fatigue d'esprit, sinon de corps, qui s'ajoute dans le visage d'un homme au travail du temps.	0.34774
The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--" she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.

In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young."

It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.	>> Il semblait que M. Shepherd, dans ses efforts pour disposer Sir Walter en faveur d'un marin, eut ete doue d'une seconde vue, car la premiere offre vint d'un amiral Croft, dont son correspondant de Londres lui avait parle.	0.302005
By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold, Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.	Selon le rapport qu'il se hata d'en faire a Kellynch, l'amiral, natif de Somersetshire et possesseur d'une tres belle fortune, desirait s'etablir dans son pays, et etait venu a Tauton chercher dans les annonces s'il trouverait quelque chose a sa convenance dans le voisinage ; n'en trouvant pas et entendant dire que Kellynch etait peut-etre a louer, il s'etait presente chez M. Shepherd pour avoir des renseignements detailles. ~~~ Il avait montre un vif desir de louer, et fourni la preuve qu'il etait un locataire recommandable.	-0.0255885
"And who is Admiral Croft?"	<< Qui est-ce que l'amiral Croft ?	0.2375
was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.	>> demanda Sir Walter d'un ton froid et soupconneux.	0.663707
Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family, and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed, added-- "He is a rear admiral of the white.	M. Shepherd repondit qu'il etait noble, et Anna ajouta : << Il est vice-amiral : il etait a Trafalgar ; depuis, il a ete aux Indes, et y est reste, je crois, plusieurs annees.	0.574956
He was in the Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I believe, several years."		-0.3
"Then I take it for granted," observed Sir Walter, "that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."	-- Alors il est convenu, dit Sir Walter, que sa figure est aussi jaune que les parements et les collets d'habits de ma livree.	0.528
Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale, hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.	>> M. Shepherd se hata de l'assurer que l'amiral avait une figure cordiale, avenante, un peu halee et fatiguee, il est vrai ; mais qu'il avait des manieres de parfait gentleman ; que probablement il ne ferait aucune difficulte quant aux conditions ; qu'il cherchait avant tout, et immediatement, une maison confortable ; qu'il payerait la convenance, et n'aurait pas ete surpris si Sir Walter avait demande davantage.	0.290152
Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant.	M. Shepherd fut eloquent, et donna sur la famille de l'amiral tous les details qui faisaient de celui-ci un locataire desirable. ~~~ Il etait marie et sans enfants, c'est ce qu'on pouvait desirer de mieux.	0.0434112
He was a married man, and without children; the very state to be wished for.	Il avait vu Mme Croft, qui avait assiste a leur conversation.	0.486538
A house was never taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.	<< C'est une vraie Lady, fine, et qui cause bien. ~~~ Elle a fait plus de questions sur la maison, les conditions, les impots, que l'amiral lui-meme. ~~~ Elle semble plus familiere que lui avec les affaires.	-0.1375
A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture in the world.	J'ai appris aussi qu'elle n'est pas inconnue dans cette contree, pas plus que son mari.	0.268657
He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over.	Elle est la soeur d'un gentilhomme qui demeurait a Montfort, il y a quelques annees. ~~~ Quel etait donc son nom, Penelope ?	-0.0191176
"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be," continued he; "asked more questions about the house, and terms, and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford.		-0.3
Bless me!	ma chere, aidez-moi.	-0.0333333
what was his name?	Le frere de Mme Croft ?	0.24375
At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.	>> Mme Clay causait avec miss Elliot d'une facon si animee, qu'elle n'entendit pas.	0.267187
Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?"	<< Je n'ai aucune idee de ce que vous voulez dire, Shepherd, dit Sir Walter.	0.171429
But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not hear the appeal.	Je ne me rappelle aucun gentilhomme demeurant a Montfort, depuis le vieux gouverneur Trent.	0.270833
"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent."	-- Par exemple, c'est trop fort, je crois que j'oublierai bientot mon nom.	0.0619048
"Bless me! ~~~ how very odd! ~~~ I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.	Un nom que je connaissais si bien ; ainsi que le gentleman, je l'ai vu cent fois.	-0.134694
A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an amicable compromise.	Il vint me consulter sur un delit de voisin, saisi sur le fait : un des domestiques du fermier s'introduisant dans son jardin, un mur eboule, des pommes volees ; puis, malgre mon avis, une transaction eut lieu.	0.16313
Very odd indeed!"	C'est vraiment singulier.	0.15
After waiting another moment-- "You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?" ~~~ said Anne.		-0.3
Mr Shepherd was all gratitude. ~~~ "Wentworth was the very name!	-- Je suppose que vous voulez parler de M. Wenvorth, dit Anna.	-0.00576923
Mr Wentworth was the very man.	-- C'est bien cela.	0.141176
He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two or three years.		-0.3
Came there about the year ---5, I take it.	Il eut la cure de Montfort pendant deux ans.	0.282857
You remember him, I am sure."	Vous devez vous le rappeler.	0.3

Oh!	ah !	0.3
ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.	oui, le ministre de Montfort, vous m'avez deroute par le mot gentilhomme.	0.102632
You misled me by the term gentleman.	Je croyais que vous parliez d'un homme possedant des proprietes.	0.0580645
I thought you were speaking of some man of property: Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.	M. Wenvorth n'en avait aucune, je crois. ~~~ C'est un nom inconnu, il n'est pas allie aux Straffort.	-0.0777108
One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common."	On se demande comment les noms de notre noblesse deviennent si communs ?	0.278947
As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.	>> M. Shepherd, s'apercevant que cette parente des Croft ne leur faisait aucun bien dans l'esprit de Sir Walter, n'en parla plus et mit tout son zele a s'etendre sur ce qui leur etait favorable : leur age, leur fortune, la haute idee qu'ils s'etaient faite de Kellynch ; ajoutant qu'ils ne desiraient rien tant que d'etre les locataires de Sir Walter.	0.379529
It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.	Cela eut semble un gout extraordinaire vraiment, s'ils avaient pu connaitre les devoirs d'un locataire de Sir Walter. ~~~ L'affaire reussit cependant, quoique Sir Walter regardat d'un mauvais oeil quiconque pretendait habiter sa maison, trouvant qu'on etait trop heureux de l'obtenir, meme aux plus dures conditions.	0.0501651
Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.	Il autorisa M. Shepherd a negocier la location et a prendre jour avec l'amiral pour visiter la propriete.	0.208457
So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and not too high.	Sir Walter ne brillait pas par le jugement ; il comprit cependant qu'on pouvait difficilement trouver un meilleur locataire. ~~~ Sa vanite etait flattee du rang de l'amiral.	-0.00642857
"I have let my house to Admiral Croft," would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of explanation.	<< J'ai loue ma maison a l'amiral Croft >> sonnerait bien mieux qu'a << monsieur un tel >>, qui exige toujours un mot d'explication.	0.278182
An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.	L'importance d'un amiral s'annonce de soi, mais il n'eclipse jamais un baronnet.	0.248571
In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence.	Dans leurs relations reciproques, Sir Elliot aurait toujours le pas.	0.770455
Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.	Elisabeth desirait si fort un changement, qu'elle ne dit pas un mot qui put retarder la decision.	-0.113415
Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a gentle sigh, "A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here."		-0.3
Chapter 4 He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half a year at Monkford.		-0.3
He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.	Anna quitta la chambre pour rafraichir ses joues brulantes ; elle alla dans son allee favorite et se dit avec un doux soupir : << Dans quelques mois peut-etre, il sera ici.	0.259859
Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail. ~~~ They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.	>> CHAPITRE IV Ce n'etait pas M. Wenvorth le ministre, mais Frederic Wenvorth, son frere, qui, nomme commandant apres l'action de Saint-Domingue, s'etait etabli, en attendant de l'emploi, dans le comte de Somerset, dans l'ete de 1806, et avait loue pour six mois a Montfort.	-0.000649351
It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted.	C'etait alors un jeune homme remarquablement beau, intelligent, spirituel et brillant, et Anna etait une tres jolie fille, douce, modeste, gracieuse et sensee.	0.256522

Troubles soon arose.	Ils jouirent bien peu de cette felicite exquise.	-0.0631579
Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.	Sir Walter, sans refuser positivement son consentement, manifesta un grand etonnement, une grande froideur et une ferme resolution de ne rien faire pour sa fille.	0.497233
He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.	Il trouvait cette alliance degradante, et lady Russel, avec un orgueil plus excusable et plus modere, la considerait comme tres facheuse.	0.287288
Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to think of!	Anna Elliot ! ~~~ avec sa beaute, sa naissance, son esprit, epouser a dix-neuf ans un jeune homme qui n'avait d'autre recommandation que sa personne, d'autre espoir de fortune que les chances incertaines de sa profession, et pas de relations qui puissent l'aider a obtenir de l'avancement !	0.0524638
Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!

It must not be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would be prevented.

Captain Wentworth had no fortune.	Plein d'ardeur et de confiance, il comptait obtenir bientot un navire.	-0.01
He had been lucky in his profession; but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.	Il avait toujours ete heureux, il le serait encore.	0.0136364
But he was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.

He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.	Ce caractere ardent, cette intrepidite d'esprit, lui semblaient plutot un mal.	0.15
Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.		-0.3
His sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her. ~~~ She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.	Il etait brillant et temeraire ; elle goutait peu l'esprit, et elle avait pour l'imprudence presque un sentiment d'horreur.	-0.00283019

Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could combat.	qu'elle avait toujours aimee et respectee, si ferme et si tendre dans ses conseils, ne pouvait pas les donner en vain.	0.156716
Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.	Son opposition ne provenait pas d'une prudence egoiste : si elle n'avait pas cru consulter plus encore le bien du jeune homme que celui de sa filleule, elle n'aurait pas empeche ce mariage.	0.0702532
She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing: indiscreet, improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.	Cette conscience du devoir rempli fut la principale consolation de lady Russel, dans cette rupture.	0.212791
But it was not a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end to it.	Elle en avait grand besoin, car elle avait a lutter contre l'opinion, et contre Wenvorth.	0.470833
Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own, she could hardly have given him up.	Celui-ci quitta le pays. ~~~ Quelques mois avaient vu le commencement et la fin de leur liaison ; mais le chagrin d'Anna fut durable.	-0.00689655
The belief of being prudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.	Ce souvenir assombrit sa jeunesse, et elle perdit sa fraicheur et sa gaiete. ~~~ Sept annees s'etaient ecoulees depuis, et le temps seul avait un peu efface ces tristes impressions.	-0.153947
He had left the country in consequence.	Aucun voyage, aucun evenement exterieur n'etait venu la distraire.	0.0794118
A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance; but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.	Dans leur petit cercle, elle n'avait vu personne qu'elle put comparer a Wenvorth ; son esprit raffine, son gout delicat, n'avaient pu trouver l'oubli dans un attachement nouveau.	0.307571
Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect.	Elle avait vingt-deux ans, quand un jeune homme, qui bientot apres fut agree par sa soeur, sollicita sa main.	0.18587
More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty or enlargement of society.		-0.3
No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.	Lady Russel deplora le refus d'Anna, car Charles Musgrove etait le fils aine d'un homme dont l'importance et les proprietes ne le cedaient qu'a Sir Walter.	0.236111
No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them.	Il avait un bon caractere, de bonnes manieres, et lady Russel se serait rejouie de voir Anna mariee aussi pres d'elle et affranchie de la partialite de son pere.	0.174627
She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself.		-0.3
But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.	Mais Anna n'avait accepte aucun avis, et sa marraine, sans regretter le passe, desespera presque, en lui voyant refuser ce mariage, de la voir entrer dans un etat qui convenait si bien a son coeur aimant et a ses habitudes domestiques.	0.169388
They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change, on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen.	Ce sujet d'entretien fut ecarte pour toujours, et elles ne purent savoir ni l'une ni l'autre si elles avaient change d'opinion ; mais Anna, a vingt-sept ans, pensait autrement qu'a dix-neuf.	0.195652
She did not blame Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her; but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.	Elle ne blamait pas lady Russel ; cependant si une jeune fille dans une situation semblable lui eut demande son avis, elle ne lui aurait pas impose un chagrin immediat en echange d'un bien futur et incertain.	0.192486
She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on.	Elle pensait qu'en depit de la desapprobation de sa famille ; malgre tous les soucis attaches a la profession de marin ; malgre tous les retards et les desappointements, elle eut ete plus heureuse en l'epousant qu'en le refusant, dut-elle avoir une part plus qu'ordinaire de soucis et d'inquietudes, sans parler de la situation actuelle de Wenvorth, qui depassait deja ce qu'on aurait pu esperer.	0.204914
All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified.	La confiance qu'il avait en lui-meme avait ete justifiee.	0.234
His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.	Son genie et son ardeur l'avaient guide et inspire.	0.143182
He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.		-0.3
He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.		-0.3
She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.	Il s'etait distingue, avait avance en grade, et possedait maintenant une belle fortune ; elle le savait par les journaux, et n'avait aucune raison de le croire marie.	0.295714
How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been!	Combien Anna eut ete eloquente dans ses conseils !	0.241667
how eloquent, at least, were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!	Combien elle preferait une inclination reciproque et une joyeuse confiance dans l'avenir a ces precautions exagerees qui entravent la vie et insultent la Providence !	0.346154
She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.	Dans sa jeunesse on l'avait forcee a etre prudente plus tard elle devint romanesque, consequence naturelle d'un commencement contre nature.	0.272973
With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.	L'arrivee du capitaine Wenvorth a Kellynch ne pouvait que raviver son chagrin.	0.095362
She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil.	Elle dut se raisonner beaucoup, et fut longtemps avant de pouvoir supporter ce sujet continuel de conversation.	0.18125
She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it.	Elle y fut aidee par la parfaite indifference des trois seules personnes de son entourage qui avaient le secret du passe, et qui semblaient l'avoir oublie ; le frere de Wenvorth avait connu, il est vrai, leur liaison, mais il avait depuis longtemps quitte le pays ; c'etait en outre un homme tres sense et un celibataire.	0.307475
She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received any information of their short-lived engagement.	Elle etait sure de sa discretion.	-0.6
That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's having heard of it from him.	Mme Croft, soeur de Wenvorth, etait alors hors d'Angleterre avec son mari ; Marie, soeur d'Anna, etait en pension ; et les uns par orgueil, les autres par delicatesse ne l'avaient pas initiee au secret.	0.285093
The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.	Anna esperait donc que l'arrivee des Croft ne lui amenerait aucune mortification. ~~~ CHAPITRE V Le jour fixe pour la visite de l'amiral et de sa femme a Kellynch, Anna crut devoir aller se promener, puis elle regretta de les avoir manques.	-0.0248744
With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch, and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not involve any particular awkwardness.	Mme Croft et Elisabeth se plurent reciproquement, et l'affaire qu'elles desiraient toutes deux fut bientot conclue.	-0.0118812
Chapter 5 On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.	L'amiral etait si gai, si ouvert, son caractere etait si genereux et si confiant, que Sir Walter fut influence favorablement.	-0.0841121
This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided the whole business at once.	Il lui fit un accueil d'autant plus poli, qu'il savait par M. Shepherd que l'amiral le considerait comme un modele de bonnes manieres.	0.201176
Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.	La maison, l'ameublement, les parterres, les conditions du bail, tout fut trouve bien, et les clercs de M. Shepherd se mirent a l'oeuvre sans changer un mot aux arrangements preliminaires.	-0.0288508
The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that "This indenture sheweth."	Sir Walter declara sans hesiter que l'amiral etait le plus beau marin qu'il eut encore vu, et alla jusqu'a dire que, s'il se faisait coiffer par son valet de chambre, il ne craindrait point d'etre vu en sa compagnie.	0.202793
Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say, that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through the park, "I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.	L'amiral, avec une cordialite sympathique, dit en sortant a sa femme : << Je pensais bien, ma chere, que tout s'arrangerait, malgre ce qu'on nous a dit a Tauton.	-0.117164
The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him."	Le baronnet n'est pas un aigle, mais il n'est pas mechant.	0.177551
--reciprocal compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.	>> On voit que, de part et d'autre, les compliments se valaient.	0.255556
The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.	Les Croft devaient prendre possession a la Saint-Michel, et Sir Walter proposait d'aller a Bath le mois precedent. ~~~ Il n'y avait pas de temps a perdre pour se preparer.	0.211708
Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon, and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything considered, she wished to remain.	Lady Russel savait qu'Anna ne serait pas consultee dans le choix de l'habitation nouvelle. ~~~ Elle aurait voulu ne la conduire a Bath qu'apres Noel ; mais, devant s'absenter de chez elle, elle ne pouvait lui donner l'hospitalite en attendant.	-0.222455
It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.	Anna, tout en regrettant de ne pouvoir jouir a la campagne des mois si doux de l'automne, sentait qu'il valait mieux ne pas rester.	0.228409
Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.	Mais un devoir a remplir l'appela ailleurs.	0.572368
Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.	Marie, qui etait souvent souffrante, et qui s'ecoutait beaucoup, avait besoin d'Anna a tout propos. ~~~ Elle se trouva indisposee, et demanda, ou plutot reclama, la compagnie de sa soeur.	-0.175633
"I cannot possibly do without Anne," was Mary's reasoning; and Elizabeth's reply was, "Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath."	<< Je ne puis m'en passer, >> ecrivait Marie ; et Elisabeth avait repondu : << Anna n'a rien de mieux a faire que de rester avec vous ; on n'a pas besoin d'elle a Bath.	0.295455
To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.	>> Etre reclamee comme une aide, quoique d'une maniere peu aimable, vaut encore mieux que d'etre repoussee. ~~~ Anna, heureuse d'etre utile et d'avoir un devoir a remplir, consentit aussitot.	-0.0814815
This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties, and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.	Cette invitation soulagea lady Russel d'un grand embarras. ~~~ Il fut convenu qu'Anna n'irait pas sans elle a Bath, et qu'elle partagerait son temps entre Uppercross-Cottage et Kellynch-Lodge.	-0.0518182
So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her, which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her.	Tout etait donc pour le mieux, mais lady Russel fut saisie d'etonnement en apprenant que Mme Clay allait a Bath avec Sir Walter et Elisabeth, qui la consideraient comme une compagne tres utile pour leur installation.	0.503995
Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore aggravation.	Lady Russel s'inquieta, et fut surtout affligee de l'injure qu'on faisait a sa filleule en lui preferant Mme Clay. ~~~ Anna etait devenue insensible a ces affronts, mais elle sentait egalement l'imprudence d'un tel arrangement.	0.082092
Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.	Joignant a une grande dose d'observation la connaissance malheureusement trop complete du caractere de son pere, elle prevoyait les plus facheux resultats de cette intimite.	0.190909
With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible.	Elle ne croyait pas qu'il eut encore aucune velleite d'epouser Mme Clay, qui etait marquee de la petite verole, avait de vilaines dents et de lourdes mains, toutes choses qu'il critiquait severement en son absence.	0.3
	Mais elle etait jeune et d'une figure agreable, et son esprit delie, ses manieres assidues avaient des seductions plus dangereuses qu'un attrait purement physique.	-0.3
She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind.	Anna sentait si vivement le danger, qu'elle ne put s'empecher de le faire voir a sa soeur.	0.212069
Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been.	Elle avait peu d'espoir d'etre ecoutee, mais elle pensait qu'Elisabeth serait plus a plaindre qu'elle-meme, si une pareille chose arrivait, et qu'elle pourrait lui reprocher de ne l'avoir pas avertie.	0.196193
Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.	Elle parla, et Elisabeth parut offensee ; elle ne pouvait concevoir comment un aussi absurde soupcon etait venu a sa soeur.	0.274038
She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.	Elle repondit avec indignation que son pere et Mme Clay savaient parfaitement se tenir a leur place.	0.163137
She spoke, and seemed only to offend.	<< Mme Clay, dit-elle avec chaleur, n'oublie jamais qui elle est.	0.075
Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.	Je connais mieux que vous ses sentiments, et je vous assure qu'en fait de mariage, ils sont particulierement delicats.	0.20198
"Mrs Clay," said she, warmly, "never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people.	Elle reprouve plus fortement que personne toute inegalite de condition et de rang.	-0.250503
And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.	<< Quant a mon pere, je n'aurais jamais cru qu'il put etre soupconne, lui qui ne s'est pas remarie a cause de nous.	0.245745
If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.	Si Mme Clay etait une tres belle personne, je reconnais que sa presence ici serait dangereuse, non pas que rien au monde puisse engager mon pere a faire un mariage degradant ; mais parce qu'il pourrait eprouver un sentiment qui le rendrait malheureux.	0.392101
But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.	Je crois que la pauvre Mme Clay, qui, malgre tous ses merites, n'a jamais passe pour jolie, peut rester ici en toute surete.	0.218447
One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.	On croirait que vous n'avez jamais entendu mon pere parler de ses imperfections, et vous l'avez entendu vingt fois.	0.296939
That tooth of her's and those freckles.	Ces dents, et ces marques de petite verole !	0.273529
Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him.	Je suis moins degoutee que lui, et j'ai connu une personne qui n'en etait pas defiguree.	0.106667
I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them.	Mais il en a horreur, vous le savez.	0.273333
You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay's freckles."	-- Il n'y a presque point de defaut physique, dit Anna, que des manieres agreables ne puissent faire oublier.	-0.0133333
"There is hardly any personal defect," replied Anne, "which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to."	-- Je pense tres differemment, dit Elisabeth d'un ton sec.	-0.012
"I think very differently," answered Elizabeth, shortly; "an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.	Des manieres agreables peuvent rehausser de beaux traits, mais elles ne peuvent en changer de vulgaires.	0.196667
However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me."	Mais comme j'ai a cela plus d'interet que personne, je trouve vos avis inutiles.	0.239706
Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good.	>> Anna fut tres contente d'avoir acheve ce qu'elle avait a dire, et crut avoir bien agi.	0.268657
Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it.	Elisabeth, quoique mecontente de l'insinuation, pouvait en faire son profit.	0.295522
The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter, Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.	Le landau mena a Bath pour la derniere fois Sir Walter, Elisabeth et Mme Clay.	0.582692
The party drove off in very good spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.	Ils etaient tous de tres bonne humeur, et Sir Walter etait meme dispose a rendre un salut de condescendance aux fermiers et aux paysans affliges qui se trouveraient sur son passage. ~~~ Pendant ce temps, Anna, triste mais calme, montait a la Lodge, ou elle devait passer la derniere semaine.	0.136286
Her friend was not in better spirits than herself.	Son amie n'etait pas plus gaie : elle sentait tres vivement cette separation.	0.139535
Lady Russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly.	La respectabilite de cette famille lui etait aussi chere que la sienne, et l'habitude avait rendu precieuses les relations quotidiennes.	-0.0941176
Their respectability was as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit.	Il etait penible de regarder les jardins deserts, et encore plus de penser aux nouveaux proprietaires.	0.3
It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.	Pour echapper a cette triste vue, et pour eviter les Croft, elle s'etait decidee a s'en aller quand Anna la quitterait. ~~~ Elles partirent donc ensemble, et Anna descendit a Uppercross, premiere station du voyage de lady Russel.	-0.00213068
Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.	Uppercross est un village de moyenne grandeur, qui, il y a quelques annees, etait tout a fait dans le vieux style anglais.	0.392199
Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.	Il contenait seulement deux maisons superieures d'apparence a celles des fermiers et des laboureurs : celle du squire avec ses hauts murs, ses portes massives et ses vieux arbres, solide et antique ; et la cure, compacte, ramassee, enfermee dans un jardin bien soigne, avec une vigne et des poiriers palissant les murs. ~~~ Mais, au mariage du jeune squire, la ferme avait ete changee en cottage pour sa residence ; et le Cottage Uppercross, avec sa veranda, ses fenetres francaises, et ses autres agrements, attirait l'oeil du voyageur a un quart de mille, aussi bien que l'imposante Great-House avec ses dependances.	-0.018934
Here Anne had often been staying.	Anna etait venue souvent la.	0.252
She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch.	Elle connaissait les chemins d'Uppercross aussi bien que ceux de Kellynch.	0.467647
The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course.	Les deux familles se voyaient si souvent, allant a toute heure l'une chez l'autre, qu'Anna fut presque surprise de trouver Marie seule.	0.3
Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper.	Mais etant seule, elle devait necessairement etre souffrante et de mauvaise humeur.	0.279452
	Marie, mieux douee qu'Elisabeth, ne valait pas sa soeur Anna comme intelligence et comme caractere.	-0.3
While well, and happy, and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits; but any indisposition sunk her completely.	Quand elle etait bien portante, heureuse et entouree, elle etait gaie et aimable, mais la moindre indisposition l'abattait.	0.421446
She had no resources for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.	Elle n'avait aucune ressource contre la solitude, et, ayant herite de la personnalite des Elliot, elle etait toujours prete a se croire negligee et meconnue.	0.341504
In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of being "a fine girl."	Physiquement, elle etait inferieure a ses deux soeurs et n'avait jamais ete que ce qu'on appelle generalement << une belle fille >>.	0.264
She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with-- "So, you are come at last!	En ce moment, elle etait couchee sur un divan dans le salon, dont l'elegant ameublement avait ete fane par quatre etes successifs et la presence de deux enfants.	0.104444
I began to think I should never see you.	L'arrivee d'Anna fut saluee par ces mots : << Ah !	0.227273
I am so ill I can hardly speak.	vous voila enfin !	0.13125
I have not seen a creature the whole morning!"	je commencais a croire que vous ne viendriez pas.	0.576923
"I am sorry to find you unwell," replied Anne.	Je suis si malade que je puis a peine parler.	0.283784
"You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!"	Je n'ai pas vu depuis le matin une creature vivante.	0.265909
"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.	-- Je suis fachee de vous trouver souffrante, repondit Anna, vous m'aviez donne jeudi de bonnes nouvelles de votre sante.	0.142718
Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not able to ring the bell!	-- Oui, je parais toujours mieux portante que je ne suis.	0.1375
So, Lady Russell would not get out.	Depuis quelque temps, je suis loin d'aller bien.	0.18
I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer."	Je ne crois pas, dans toute ma vie, avoir ete si souffrante que ce matin.	0.272727
Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.	J'aurais pu me trouver mal, et personne pour me soigner.	0.2875
"Oh! ~~~ Charles is out shooting.	Ainsi lady Russel n'a pas voulu entrer ?	-0.0321429
I have not seen him since seven o'clock.	je ne crois pas qu'elle soit venue ici trois fois cet ete.	0.176471
He would go, though I told him how ill I was.	>> Anna s'etant informee de son beau-frere, Marie lui repondit : << Charles est a la chasse ; je ne l'ai pas apercu depuis sept heures du matin.	-0.383333
He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.	Il a voulu partir, quoiqu'il ait vu combien j'etais souffrante ; il disait ne pas rester longtemps, mais il est une heure, et il n'est pas rentre.	0.0958333
I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning."	Je n'ai pas vu une ame pendant toute cette longue matinee.	0.287755
"You have had your little boys with you?"	-- Vous avez eu vos petits garcons avec vous ?	0.274286
"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good.	-- Oui, tant que j'ai pu supporter leur bruit ; mais ils sont si indisciplines qu'ils me font plus de mal que de bien.	0.403162
Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad."	Le petit Charles ne m'ecoute pas, et Walter devient aussi mechant que lui.	0.719048
"Well, you will soon be better now," replied Anne, cheerfully.	-- Vous allez bientot vous trouver mieux, dit gaiement Anna.	0.288462
"You know I always cure you when I come.	Vous savez que je vous gueris toujours.	0.290909
How are your neighbours at the Great House?"	Comment se portent vos voisins de Great-House ?	0.276316
"I can give you no account of them. ~~~ I have not seen one of them to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was, not one of them have been near me.	-- Je n'en sais rien, je ne les ai pas vus aujourd'hui, excepte M. Musgrove, qui s'est arrete et m'a parle a la fenetre, mais sans descendre de cheval, quoique je lui aie dit combien j'etais souffrante.	0.0376773
It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out of their way."	Personne n'est venu pres de moi.	-0.332143
"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.	Cela ne convenait pas aux misses Musgrove ; sans doute elles n'aiment pas a se deranger.	0.164706
It is early." ~~~ "I never want them, I assure you.	-- Elles peuvent encore venir, il est de bonne heure.	-0.0146341
They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me. ~~~ Oh!	-- Je n'ai pas besoin d'elles ; elles parlent et rient beaucoup trop pour moi.	-0.0666667
Anne, I am so very unwell!	Je suis tres malade, Anna.	0.286364
It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday."	C'etait peu aimable a vous de ne pas venir jeudi.	0.285366
"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!	-- Ma chere Marie, rappelez-vous les bonnes nouvelles que vous m'avez donnees de votre sante.	0.230769
You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner."	Le ton de votre lettre etait gai, et vous disiez que rien ne pressait pour mon arrivee ; et puis mon desir etait de rester avec lady Russel jusqu'a la fin. ~~~ J'ai ete si occupee que je ne pouvais quitter Kellynch plus tot.	-0.088674
"Dear me!	-- Mon Dieu !	0.233333
what can you possibly have to do?"	qu'avez-vous eu a faire ?	0.204545
"A great many things, I assure you.		-0.3
More than I can recollect in a moment; but I can tell you some.	-- Beaucoup de choses : je ne puis tout me rappeler.	0.244186
I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures.	J'ai fait une copie du catalogue des livres et tableaux de mon pere.	0.451128
I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell.	J'ai ete souvent au jardin avec Mackensie, tachant de lui faire comprendre quelles sont les plantes d'Elisabeth destinees a lady Russel.	0.269231
I have had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.	J'ai eu mes livres, ma musique a arranger, et a refaire toutes mes malles, pour n'avoir pas compris d'abord ce qu'il fallait emporter.	0.188938
I was told that they wished it.	Enfin, j'ai ete visiter toutes les maisons de la paroisse.	0.0230769
But all these things took up a great deal of time." ~~~ "Oh!	Tout cela prend beaucoup de temps.	-0.06
well!"	-- Ah !	0.25
and after a moment's pause, "but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."	mais vous ne me parlez pas de notre diner chez les Pools, hier ?	0.280769
"Did you go then?	-- Vous y etes donc allee ?	0.16
I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party."	Je croyais que vous aviez du y renoncer ?	-0.0970588
"Oh yes!	-- Oh !	0.2
I went.	j'y suis allee !	0
I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning.	Je me portais tres bien hier.	0.236571
It would have been strange if I had not gone."	Jusqu'a ce matin je n'etais pas malade ; n'y pas aller aurait semble singulier.	0.0710526
"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party."	-- J'en suis tres contente : j'espere que vous vous etes amusee ?	0.261111
"Nothing remarkable.	-- Pas trop.	0.0545455
One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one's own.	On sait d'avance le diner et les personnes qui y seront. ~~~ Quel ennui de n'avoir pas une voiture a soi !	-0.0582353
Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded!	M. et Mme Musgrove m'ont emmenee, et nous etions trop serres.	0.487209
They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward.	Ils sont si gros, et occupent tant de place !	-0.00810811
So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it."	J'etais entassee au fond avec Henriette et Louise. ~~~ Voila tres probablement la cause de mon malaise.	-0.0482759
A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's. ~~~ She could soon sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time.	>> La patience et la bonne humeur d'Anna apporterent bientot un soulagement a Marie, qui put s'asseoir, et espera pouvoir se lever pour diner.	0.124221
Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk.	Puis, oubliant qu'elle etait malade, elle alla a l'autre bout de la chambre, arrangea des fleurs, mangea quelque chose et se trouva assez bien pour proposer une petite promenade.	0.385417
"Where shall we go?"	<< Ou allons-nous ?	0.282353
said she, when they were ready.		-0.3
"I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you?"	dit-elle : sans doute vous n'irez pas a Great-House avant qu'on vous ait fait visite ?	0.295833
"I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied Anne.	-- Mais si, dit Anna ; je ne suis pas sur l'etiquette avec les dames Musgrove.	0.263158
"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves."		-0.3
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.	c'est a elles de venir, elles doivent savoir ce qui est du a ma soeur.	0.202326
They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.	Cependant nous pouvons y entrer avant de faire notre promenade.	0.197561
However, we may as well go and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can enjoy our walk."	>> Anna avait toujours trouve tres facheuse cette facon de comprendre les relations ; mais, croyant qu'on avait a se plaindre de part et d'autre, elle avait cesse de s'en occuper.	0.22
Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that, though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither family could now do without it.	Elles allerent a Great-House. ~~~ On les introduisit dans un antique parloir carre, au parquet brillant et orne d'un maigre tapis.	-0.121364
To the Great House accordingly they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour, with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction.

could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!	si les originaux des portraits accroches a la boiserie, si les gentilshommes habilles de velours brun, et les dames, en satin bleu, avaient vu ce bouleversement de l'ordre et de la proprete !	0.433346
The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment.	Les portraits eux-memes semblaient saisis d'etonnement !	0.651471
The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration, perhaps of improvement.	Les Musgrove, comme leur maison, representaient deux epoques.	0.185455
The father and mother were in the old English style, and the young people in the new.	Les parents etaient dans le vieux style anglais, les enfants, dans le nouveau.	0.286567
Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and not at all elegant.	M. et Mme Musgrove etaient de tres bonnes gens, affectueux et hospitaliers, sans grande education et sans aucune elegance.	0.435
Their children had more modern minds and manners.	Leurs enfants avaient un esprit et des facons plus modernes.	0.237209
There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.	La famille etait nombreuse, mais c'etaient encore des enfants, excepte Charles, Louise et Henriette, jeunes filles de dix-neuf et vingt ans, qui avaient rapporte a la maison le bagage ordinaire des talents de pension, et n'avaient, comme mille autres jeunes filles, rien a faire, que d'etre gaies, heureuses, et suivre les modes.	0.392518
Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.	Leurs vetements etaient parfaits, leurs figures assez jolies, leur esprit extremement bon, et leurs manieres simples et agreables. ~~~ Elles etaient tres appreciees a la maison, et tres recherchees au dehors.	-0.0108434
Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters.	Anna les trouvait fort heureuses ; mais cependant, soutenue, comme nous le sommes tous, par le sentiment de sa superiorite, elle n'aurait pas voulu changer contre toutes leurs jouissances son esprit cultive et elegant. ~~~ Elle n'enviait que la bonne intelligence qui semblait regner entre elles, et cette mutuelle affection qu'elle-meme avait si peu connue.	-0.0582237
They were received with great cordiality.	Elles furent recues tres cordialement, et Anna ne trouva rien a critiquer.	0.0810811
Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.	La demi-heure s'ecoula en causerie agreable, et Anna ne fut pas peu surprise de voir les misses Musgrove les accompagner a la promenade sur l'invitation pressante de Marie.	0.174757
The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation.	CHAPITRE VI Anna n'avait pas besoin de cette visite pour savoir qu'un changement de societe amene un changement total de conversation, d'opinions et d'idees.	0.235556
Chapter 6 Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.	Elle aurait voulu que les Elliot pussent voir combien leurs affaires, traitees avec une telle solennite a Kellynch, avaient ici peu d'importance.	0.281635
She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: "So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in?"		-0.3
and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, "I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!"	Cependant elle sentit qu'elle avait encore besoin d'une lecon, car elle avait compte sur plus de curiosite et de sympathie qu'elle n'en trouva. ~~~ On lui avait bien dit : << Ainsi, miss Anna, votre pere et votre soeur sont partis ?	-0.00741758
or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!"	>> Ou bien : << J'espere que nous irons aussi a Bath cet hiver ; mais nous comptons loger dans un beau quartier.	0.237363
She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.	>> Ou bien, Marie disait : << En verite ! ~~~ comme je m'amuserai seule ici pendant que vous serez a Bath !	-0.135882
The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.	>> Anna se promettait de ne plus eprouver a l'avenir de telles deceptions, et pensait avec reconnaissance au bonheur inexprimable d'avoir une amie vraie et sympathique comme lady Russel. ~~~ Cependant elle trouvait tres juste que chaque societe dictat ses sujets de conversation.	-0.0251232
She acknowledged it to be very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.	Les messieurs Musgrove avaient leur chasse, leurs chevaux, leurs chiens, leurs journaux. ~~~ Les dames avaient les soins d'interieur, la toilette, les voisins, la danse et la musique.	-0.025
With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.	Anna, devant passer deux mois a Uppercross, devait meubler son imagination et sa memoire avec les choses d'Uppercross.	0.293189
She had no dread of these two months.	Elle ne redoutait pas ces deux mois.	0.3
Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort.	Marie etait abordable et accessible a son influence. ~~~ Anna etait sur un pied de bonne amitie avec son beau-frere ; les enfants l'aimaient presque autant et la respectaient plus que leur mere.	-0.00277778
She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.	Ils etaient pour elle une source d'interet, d'amusement et d'occupation. ~~~ Charles etait poli et agreable ; il etait certainement, comme esprit et comme bon sens, superieur a sa femme.	-0.0334395
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation, or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.	Cependant Anna et lady Russel pensaient qu'une femme intelligente aurait pu donner a son caractere plus de suite, a ses habitudes plus d'elegance, a ses occupations plus d'utilite et de sens pratique.	0.101551
As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.	Il ne mettait beaucoup d'ardeur a rien, si ce n'est au jeu, et il gaspillait son temps.	0.120833
He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple.	Il etait d'un caractere gai, s'affectant peu des doleances de sa femme ; il supportait son manque de bon sens avec une patience qui emerveillait Anna, et en definitive, malgre quelques petites querelles (ou les deux parties appelaient Anna, a son grand regret), ce couple pouvait passer pour heureux.	0.307826
They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.	Il y avait une chose sur laquelle ils etaient toujours parfaitement d'accord : le besoin d'argent et le desir de recevoir un cadeau de M. Musgrove. ~~~ Quant a l'education de leurs enfants, la theorie de Charles etait meilleure que celle de sa femme.	-0.0652174
As to the management of their children, his theory was much better than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.	<< Je les gouvernerais tres bien, si Marie ne s'en melait pas, >> disait-il, et Anna trouvait que c'etait assez vrai.	0.283871
"I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary's interference," was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of "Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order," she never had the smallest temptation to say, "Very true."	Mais quand Marie repondait a cela : << Charles gate tellement les enfants que je ne puis en venir a bout, >> Anna n'etait jamais tentee de dire que c'etait vrai.	0.0982955
One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.	Ce qu'il y avait de moins agreable dans son sejour, c'etait d'etre la confidente de tous les partis.	0.0285714
Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.	On savait qu'elle avait quelque influence sur sa soeur, et l'on voulait qu'elle s'en servit, meme au dela du possible.	0.370857
"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill," was Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: "I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was anything the matter with me.	<< Tachez donc de persuader a Marie de ne pas toujours se croire malade, >> disait Charles. ~~~ Et Marie disait : << Je crois que si Charles me voyait mourante, il dirait encore que ce n'est rien.	-0.0377358
I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever own."	Vous pouvez, Anna, lui persuader que je suis plus malade que je ne l'avoue.	0.147619
Mary's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day."	>> Ou bien : << Je n'aime pas a envoyer les enfants a Great-House, quoique leur grand'mere les demande toujours. ~~~ Elle les gate tellement, et leur donne tant de friandises qu'ils reviennent malades et grognons pour le reste de la journee.	-0.03375
And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne, to say, "Oh!	>> Et Mme Musgrove mere, aussitot qu'elle etait seule avec Anna, disait : << Ah !	0.478545
Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.	miss Anna ! ~~~ si seulement Mme Charles avait un peu de votre methode avec les enfants !	0.0581967
They are quite different creatures with you!	Ils sont tout autres avec vous !	0.166667
But to be sure, in general they are so spoilt!	Il faut convenir qu'ils sont bien gates !	0.274286
It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them. ~~~ They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen, poor little dears!	Ils sont aussi beaux et aussi bien portants que possible, les chers petits, mais ma belle-fille ne sait pas s'y prendre avec eux !	-0.0111111
without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!		-0.3
Bless me!	Mon Dieu !	0.3
how troublesome they are sometimes.	qu'ils sont ennuyeux quelquefois !	0.290323
I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should.	Je vous assure que c'est la ce qui m'empeche de les avoir autant que je voudrais.	0.395874
I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them." ~~~ She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.	Je crois que Marie est mecontente que je ne les invite pas plus souvent, mais vous savez combien il est desagreable d'avoir des enfants qu'il faut gronder a chaque instant : << Ne faites pas ceci, ne touchez pas a cela, >> ou qu'on ne peut tenir tranquilles qu'en leur donnant trop de gateaux.	-0.00248963
"Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.	>> Marie disait encore : << Mme Musgrove croit ses domestiques si fideles que ce serait un crime de mettre cela en question ; mais je n'exagere pas en disant que sa cuisiniere et sa femme de chambre flanent toute la journee dans le village.	0.328669
I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them.	Je les rencontre partout, et je ne vais pas deux fois dans la chambre des enfants sans rencontrer l'une des deux.	0.283146
If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them."	Si Jemina n'etait pas la creature la plus fidele et la plus sure, cela suffirait pour la gater.	0.218654
And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.	>> Et Mme Musgrove : << Je me fais une loi de ne jamais me meler des affaires de ma belle-fille, mais je vous dirai, miss Anna, (parce que vous pouvez y remedier), que je n'ai pas bonne opinion de sa femme de chambre, j'entends d'etranges histoires.	0.0933824
Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of mentioning it."	Elle est toujours dehors, et s'habille comme une dame. ~~~ C'en est assez pour perdre tous les autres domestiques.	-0.0796875
Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.	Marie ne voit que par ses yeux ; mais je vous avertis : soyez sur vos gardes, parce que, si vous decouvrez quelque chose, il ne faut pas craindre de le dire. ~~~ >> Marie se plaignait aussi de n'avoir pas a table la place qui lui etait due.	-0.0171875
And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, "I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.	Quand, a Great-House, il y avait d'autres invites, on la placait comme si elle etait de la maison. ~~~ Un jour qu'Anna se promenait avec les misses Musgrove, l'une d'elles, parlant de noblesse et de susceptibilites de rang, dit : << Je n'ai aucun scrupule a vous dire, parce qu'on sait que vous y etes indifferente, combien quelques personnes sont absurdes pour garder leur rang.	-0.0123708
Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.	Cependant je voudrais qu'on put faire comprendre a Marie qu'elle ne devrait pas etre si tenace, et surtout ne pas se mettre toujours a la place de ma mere.	0.219802
It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many persons."	Personne ne doute de son droit a cet egard, mais il serait plus convenable de ne pas toujours le garder.	0.293023
How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?	Ce n'est pas que maman s'en soucie le moins du monde, mais beaucoup de personnes le remarquent.	0
She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister's benefit.		-0.3
In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.	>> Comment Anna aurait-elle pu concilier tout le monde ?	0.2625
Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.	Elle ne pouvait qu'ecouter patiemment, apaiser les griefs ; excuser l'un, puis l'autre ; les engager a l'indulgence necessaire entre voisins, surtout quand il s'agissait de sa soeur. ~~~ Sa visite eut du reste un bon resultat ; le changement de place lui fit du bien, et Marie, ayant une compagne assidue, se plaignit moins.	0.0389464
It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.	Les relations quotidiennes avec l'autre famille etaient tres agreables, mais Anna pensait que tout n'aurait pas ete si bien sans la presence de M. et de Mme Musgrove, ou les rires, les causeries et les chansons des jeunes filles.	0.182812
She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware.	Elle etait meilleure musicienne que celles-ci ; mais, n'ayant ni voix, ni connaissance de la harpe, ni parents indulgents pour s'extasier sur son jeu, on ne pensait guere a lui demander de jouer, sinon par simple politesse, ou pour laisser reposer les autres.	0.344787
She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.	Elle savait depuis longtemps qu'en jouant elle ne faisait plaisir qu'a elle-meme.	0.24507
Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.	Excepte pendant une courte periode de sa vie, elle n'avait jamais, depuis la mort de sa mere cherie, connu le bonheur d'etre ecoutee et encouragee.	0.162097
In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own.	Elle y etait accoutumee, et la partialite de M. et Mme Musgrove pour leurs filles, loin de la vexer, lui faisait plutot plaisir, a cause de l'amitie qu'elle leur portait.	0.133099
The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.	Quelques personnes augmentaient parfois le cercle de Great-House.	0.294915
The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.	Il y avait peu de voisins, mais les Musgrove voyaient tout le monde, et avaient plus de diners et de visites qu'aucune autre famille.	0.162162
They were more completely popular.	Ils etaient tres populaires.	0.242308
The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally, in an unpremeditated little ball.	Les jeunes filles aimaient passionnement la danse, et les soirees se terminaient souvent par un petit bal improvise.	0.266667
There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--"Well done, Miss Anne! ~~~ very well done indeed!	A quelques minutes d'Uppercross habitait une famille de cousins, moins riches, qui recevaient tous leurs plaisirs des Musgrove. ~~~ Ils venaient n'importe quand, organisaient un jeu ou un bal a l'improviste, et Anna, qui preferait a un role plus actif s'asseoir au piano, leur jouait des danses de village pendant une heure de suite, obligeance qui attirait sur son talent musical l'attention des Musgrove, et lui valait souvent ce compliment : << Tres bien, miss Anna, tres bien, vraiment.	-0.14373
Lord bless me!	Bonte du ciel !	0.3
how those little fingers of yours fly about!"	Comme vos petits doigts courent sur le piano !	0.3
So passed the first three weeks. ~~~ Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart must be in Kellynch again.	>> Ainsi passerent les trois premieres semaines, puis vint la Saint-Michel, et le coeur d'Anna retourna a Kellynch.	-0.0267857
A beloved home made over to others; all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!	La maison aimee occupee par d'autres ! ~~~ D'autres gens jouissant des chambres, des meubles, des bosquets et des points de vue !	-0.0168224
She could not think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?	Elle ne put penser a autre chose le 29 septembre, et Marie, remarquant le quantieme du mois, fit cette sympathique remarque : << Mon Dieu ! ~~~ n'est-ce pas aujourd'hui que les Croft entrent a Kellynch ?	-0.0368263
I am glad I did not think of it before.	Je suis contente de n'y avoir pas pense plus tot.	0.203226
How low it makes me!"	Cela m'impressionne desagreablement.	0.0166667
The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be visited.	>> Les Croft prirent possession avec une exactitude militaire.	0.54
Mary deplored the necessity for herself.	Une visite leur etait due.	0.130435
	Marie deplora cette necessite : personne ne savait combien cela la faisait souffrir.	-0.3
"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.	Elle reculerait autant qu'elle pourrait.	0.282857
She should put it off as long as she could;" but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.	Neanmoins elle n'eut pas un moment de repos tant que Charles ne l'y eut pas conduite, et, quand elle revint, son agitation n'avait rien que d'agreable.	0.290639
Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.	Anna se rejouit sincerement qu'il n'y eut pas de place pour elle dans la voiture.	0.254237
She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.	Elle desirait cependant voir les Croft, et fut contente d'etre a la maison quand ils rendirent la visite.	0.253247
They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.	Charles etait absent. ~~~ Tandis que l'amiral, assis pres de Marie, se rendait agreable en s'occupant des petits garcons, Mme Croft s'entretenait avec Anna, qui put ainsi etablir une ressemblance avec son frere, sinon dans les traits, du moins dans la voix et la tournure d'esprit.	-0.0453488
Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.	Mme Croft, sans etre grande ni grosse, avait une carrure et une prestance qui donnaient de l'importance a sa personne.	0.561714
She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.	Elle avait de brillants yeux noirs, de belles dents et une figure agreable ; mais son teint hale et rougi par la vie sur mer lui donnait quelques annees de plus que ses trente-huit ans.	0.126316
Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.	Ses manieres ouvertes, aisees et decidees n'avaient aucune rudesse et ne manquaient pas de bonne humeur.	0.0933333
Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.	Anna crut avec plaisir aux sentiments de consideration exprimes pour la famille et pour elle-meme, car, des le premier moment, elle s'etait assuree que Mme Croft n'avait aucun soupcon du passe.	0.141311
She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,-- "It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country."	Tranquille sur ce point, elle se sentait pleine de force et de courage, quand ces mots de Mme Croft lui donnerent un coup subit : << C'est vous, n'est-ce pas, et non votre soeur que mon frere eut le plaisir de connaitre quand il etait dans ce pays ?	0.322871
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not.	>> Anna esperait avoir depasse l'age ou l'on rougit ; mais certainement elle fut emue.	0.279452
"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?"	<< Peut-etre ne savez-vous pas qu'il est marie ?	0.278049
added Mrs Croft. ~~~ She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother.	>> Elle ne sut quoi repondre ; et quand Mme Croft expliqua qu'il s'agissait du ministre Wenvorth, elle fut heureuse de n'avoir rien dit qui put la trahir.	-0.0421875
She immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's present state with proper interest.	Il etait bien naturel que Mme Croft pensat a Edouard Wenvorth plutot qu'a Frederic. ~~~ Honteuse de l'avoir oublie, elle s'informa avec interet de leur ancien, voisin.	-0.0840426
The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she heard the Admiral say to Mary-- "We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you know him by name."	Le reste de la conversation n'offrit rien de remarquable, mais en partant, elle entendit l'amiral dire a Marie : << Nous attendons un frere de Mme Croft, je crois que vous le connaissez de nom !	0.365292
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.	>> Il fut interrompu par les petits garcons, qui s'accrochaient a lui comme a un vieil ami et ne voulaient pas le laisser partir : il leur offrit de les emporter dans ses poches, et fut bientot trop accapare pour finir sa phrase ou se souvenir de ce qu'il avait dit.	0.154839
She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.	Anna tacha de se persuader qu'il s'agissait toujours d'Edouard Wenvorth ; mais cela ne l'empecha point de se demander si l'on avait parle de cela dans l'autre maison, ou les Croft etaient alles d'abord.	0.289024
The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.	On attendait ce soir-la au cottage la famille de Great-House. ~~~ Tout a coup Louisa entra seule, disant qu'elle etait venue a pied pour laisser plus de place a la harpe qu'on apportait.	-0.0409091
That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.	<< Et je vais vous dire pourquoi, dit-elle : Papa et maman sont tout tristes ce soir, maman surtout ; elle pense au pauvre Richard ; et nous avons eu l'idee d'apporter la harpe, qui l'amuse plus que le piano.	0.169412
"And I will tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it.	Je vais vous dire ce qui la rend si triste.	0.154286
I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!	Mme Croft nous a dit ce matin que son frere, le capitaine Wenvorth, est rentre en Angleterre, et ira prochainement les voir.	0.259615
And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.	Maman s'est souvenue que Wenvorth est le nom du capitaine de notre frere Richard.	0.243478
I will tell you why she is out of spirits.	Elle a relu ses lettres, et maintenant elle ne pense qu'a son pauvre fils qu'elle a perdu.	-0.0617647
When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?	Soyons aussi gaies que possible, pour que sa pensee ne s'appesantisse pas sur un si triste sujet.	0.243478
), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow!	>> La verite de cette pathetique histoire etait que les Musgrove avaient eu le malheur d'avoir un fils mauvais sujet, et la chance de le perdre avant qu'il eut atteint sa vingtieme annee.	-0.0288462
And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!	On l'avait fait marin, parce qu'il etait stupide et ingouvernable ; on se souciait tres peu de lui, mais assez pour ce qu'il valait.	0.215455
So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things."	Il ne fut guere regrette quand la nouvelle de sa mort arriva a Uppercross, deux annees auparavant.	0.249296
The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.		-0.3
He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him "poor Richard," been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead.	Ses soeurs faisaient aujourd'hui pour lui tout ce qu'elles pouvaient faire en l'appelant << pauvre Richard >>, mais en realite il n'avait ete rien de plus que le lourd, insensible et inutile Dick Musgrove ; n'ayant droit, vivant ou mort, qu'a ce diminutif de son nom.	0.335579
He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money.	Il avait ete plusieurs annees en mer, et dans le cours de ces changements frequents pour les mousses dont le capitaine desire se debarrasser, il avait ete six mois sur la fregate Laconia, commandee par le capitaine Frederic Wenvorth, et sous l'influence de ce dernier, il avait ecrit a ses parents les deux seules lettres desinteressees qu'ils eussent jamais recues de lui ; les autres n'etaient que des demandes d'argent.	0.261745
In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.	Il disait toujours du bien de son capitaine, mais ses parents s'en souciaient si peu qu'ils n'y avaient fait aucune attention, et si Mme Musgrove fut frappee par le nom de Wenvorth associe avec celui de son fils, c'etait par un de ces phenomenes de la memoire assez frequents chez les personnes distraites.	0.204967
She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death.	Elle avait relu les lettres de ce fils perdu pour toujours, et cette lecture, apres un si long intervalle, alors que les fautes etaient oubliees, l'avait affectee plus profondement que la nouvelle de sa mort.	0.218762
Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.	M. Musgrove l'etait aussi, mais a un moindre degre, et en arrivant au cottage ils avaient besoin d'etre ecoutes et egayes.	0.269815
To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves. ~~~ She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.	Ce fut une nouvelle epreuve pour Anna d'entendre parler de Wenvorth, et repeter son nom si souvent, d'entendre disputer sur les dates, et affirmer enfin que ce ne pouvait etre que le capitaine Wenvorth, ce beau jeune homme qu'on avait rencontre plusieurs fois en revenant de Clifton huit annees auparavant.	-0.0563953
Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points.	Elle vit qu'il fallait s'accoutumer a ce supplice, et tacher de devenir insensible a cette arrivee.	0.472941
And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as "a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster," were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival.	Non seulement il etait attendu prochainement, mais les Musgrove, reconnaissants des bontes qu'il avait eues pour leur fils, et pleins de respect pour le caractere que Dick leur avait depeint, desiraient vivement faire sa connaissance.	0.049005
The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.	Cette resolution contribua a leur faire passer une soiree agreable.	0.567643
Chapter 7 A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week.	CHAPITRE VII Quelques jours plus tard, on sut que le capitaine etait a Kellynch. ~~~ M. Musgrove lui fit visite et revint enchante.	-0.0142202
It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars.	Il l'avait invite a diner avec les Croft pour la semaine suivante, et n'avait pu, a son grand regret, fixer un jour plus rapproche.	0.147523
But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.	Anna calcula qu'elle n'avait plus qu'une semaine de tranquillite ; mais elle faillit rencontrer le capitaine, qui rendit aussitot a M. Musgrove sa visite.	0.413182
Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility, and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.	Elle et Marie se dirigeaient vers Great-House quand on vint leur dire que l'aine des petits garcons avait fait une chute grave : l'enfant avait une luxation de la colonne vertebrale.	0.162857
She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall.	On revint en toute hate. ~~~ Anna dut etre partout a la fois, chercher le docteur, avertir le pere, s'occuper de la mere pour empecher une attaque de nerfs, diriger les domestiques, renvoyer le plus jeune enfant, soigner et soulager le pauvre malade, enfin donner des nouvelles aux Musgrove, dont l'arrivee lui donna plus d'embarras que d'aide.	-0.0146163
The child's situation put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account.	Le retour de son beau-frere la soulagea beaucoup ; il pouvait au moins prendre soin de sa femme.	0
His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.	Le docteur examina l'enfant, remit la fracture et parla ensuite a voix basse et d'un air inquiet au pere et a la mere.	0.296907
It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.		-0.3
Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.	Cependant il donna bon espoir, et l'on put aller diner plus tranquillement.	0.0646154
Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all a favourite before.		-0.3
How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought.	Les deux jeunes filles resterent quelques instants apres le depart de leurs parents pour raconter la visite du capitaine ; dire combien elles etaient enchantees et contentes que leur pere l'eut invite a diner pour le lendemain.	0.26102
And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.	Il avait accepte d'une maniere charmante, comme s'il comprenait le motif de cette politesse.	-0.22125
The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy, to give him the meeting.		-0.3
"Oh no; as to leaving the little boy," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.	Il avait parle et agi avec une grace si exquise, qu'il leur avait tourne la tete. ~~~ Elles s'echapperent en courant, plus occupees du capitaine que du petit garcon.	-0.0427007
Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; "the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour."	La meme histoire et les memes ravissements se repeterent le soir, quand elles vinrent avec leur pere prendre des nouvelles de l'enfant.	0
But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh!	M. Musgrove confirma ces louanges.	0.145161
no, indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.	Il ne pouvait reculer l'invitation faite le matin au capitaine, et regrettait que les habitants du cottage ne pussent venir aussi.	-0.123913
Only think if anything should happen?"	Ils ne voudraient sans doute pas quitter l'enfant.	0.211765
The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.	<< Oh ! ~~~ non, >> s'ecrierent le pere et la mere.	-0.04125
It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer confinement.	Mais bientot Charles changea d'avis ; puisque l'enfant allait si bien, il pouvait aller passer une heure a Great-House apres le diner.	0.384554
The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?	Mais sa femme s'y opposa : << Oh !	-0.333333
This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.	non, Charles, je ne souffrirai pas que vous sortiez. ~~~ Si quelque chose arrivait !	-0.0535714
His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.	>> L'enfant eut une bonne nuit et alla mieux le lendemain ; le docteur ne voyait rien d'alarmant, et Charles commenca a trouver inutile de se sequestrer ainsi.	0.198185
"Nothing can be going on better than the child," said he; "so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.	L'enfant devait rester couche, et s'amuser aussi tranquillement que possible.	0.108696
Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.	Mais que pouvait faire le pere ?	0.0333333
You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.	C'etait l'affaire d'une femme, et ce serait absurde a lui de s'enfermer a la maison.	0.232759
Anne will send for me if anything is the matter."	D'ailleurs son pere desirait beaucoup le presenter a Wenvorth.	0.197561
Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.	Au retour de la chasse, il declara audacieusement qu'il allait s'habiller et diner chez son pere.	0.191803
Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.	<< Votre soeur est avec vous, ma chere, et vous-meme, vous n'aimeriez pas a quitter l'enfant.	0.197468
She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only Anne to hear-- "So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!	Je suis inutile ici, Anna m'enverra chercher s'il est necessaire. ~~~ >> Les femmes comprennent generalement quand l'opposition est inutile.	-0.0805785
I knew how it would be. ~~~ This is always my luck.	Marie vit que Charles etait decide a partir.	-0.00789474
	Elle ne dit rien, mais aussitot qu'elle fut seule avec Anna : << Ainsi on nous laisse seules nous distraire comme nous pourrons avec ce pauvre enfant malade, et pas une ame pour nous tenir compagnie le soir.	-0.3
If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles is as bad as any of them.	Je le prevoyais ; je n'ai pas de chance ; s'il survient une chose desagreable, les hommes s'en dispensent.	0.279775
Very unfeeling!	Charles ne vaut pas mieux que les autres.	-0.1
I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.	Il n'a pas de coeur ; laisser ainsi son pauvre petit garcon !	0.198
Talks of his being going on so well!	Il dit qu'il va mieux.	0.126316
How does he know that he is going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?	Sait-il s'il n'y aura point un changement soudain, dans une demi-heure ?	0.203226
I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.	Je ne croyais pas Charles si egoiste.	0.553125
So here he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child.	Ainsi, il va s'amuser, et parce que je suis la pauvre mere, il ne m'est pas permis de bouger ; et cependant je suis moins capable que personne de soigner l'enfant.	0.273134
My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.	Precisement parce que je suis sa mere, on ne devrait pas me mettre a une telle epreuve.	0.251613
I am not at all equal to it.	Je ne suis pas de force a la supporter.	0.163636
You saw how hysterical I was yesterday."	Vous savez combien j'ai souffert des nerfs hier ?	0.24
	-- C'etait l'effet d'une commotion soudaine ; j'espere que rien n'arrivera qui puisse nous effrayer.	-0.3
"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the shock.	J'ai bien compris les instructions du docteur, et je ne crains rien.	0.268966
You will not be hysterical again.	Vraiment, Marie, je ne suis pas surprise que votre mari soit sorti.	0.0103448
I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us.	Ce n'est pas l'affaire des hommes.	0.2
I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.	-- Il me semble que je suis aussi bonne mere qu'une autre ; mais ma presence n'est pas plus utile ici que celle de Charles.	0.297
Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.	Je ne puis pas toujours gronder et tourmenter un pauvre petit malade.	0.223404
A sick child is always the mother's property: her own feelings generally make it so."	Vous avez vu, ce matin, quand je lui disais de se tenir tranquille, il s'est mis a donner des coups de pied autour de lui.	0.1875
"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin kicking about.		-0.3
I have not nerves for the sort of thing."	Je n'ai pas la patience qu'il faut pour cela.	0.264706
"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy?"	-- Seriez-vous tranquille si vous passiez votre soiree loin de lui ?	0.17069
"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?	-- Pourquoi non ? ~~~ son pere le fait bien.	-0.0214286
Jemima is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.	Jemina certainement est si soigneuse.	0.0882353
I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.	Charles aurait pu dire a son pere que nous irions tous.	0.43913
I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.	Je ne suis pas plus inquiete que lui.	0.135484
I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."	Hier, c'etait bien different, mais aujourd'hui ! ~~~ -- Eh bien !	-0.0305556
"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself, suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.	si vous croyez qu'il n'est pas trop tard pour avertir, laissez-moi soigner le petit Charles.	0.243038
Leave little Charles to my care.		-0.3
Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him."	M. et Mme Musgrove ne trouveront pas mauvais que je reste avec lui.	0.514286
"Are you serious?"	-- Parlez-vous serieusement ?	0.123529
cried Mary, her eyes brightening.	dit Marie les yeux brillants.	0.253846
"Dear me!	Mon Dieu quelle bonne idee !	-0.2
that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.	En verite, autant que j'y aille.	0.171429
To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?	Je ne sers a rien ici, n'est-ce pas ?	0.03
and it only harasses me.	et cela me tourmente.	0.268421
You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest person.	Vous n'avez pas les sentiments d'une mere : vous etes la personne qu'il faut.	0.3
You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you at a word.		-0.3
It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima.	Jules vous obeit au moindre mot.	0.0214286
Oh!	Ah !	0.3
I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.	bien certainement j'irai, car on desire beaucoup que je fasse connaissance avec le capitaine, et cela ne vous fait rien de rester seule.	0.198261
An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.	Quelle excellente idee !	0.0681818
I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.	Je vais le dire a Charles, et je serai bientot prete.	0.565751
You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.	Vous nous enverrez chercher, s'il le faut, mais j'espere que rien d'alarmant ne surviendra.	0.201266
I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child."	Je n'irais pas, croyez-le bien, si je n'etais tout a fait tranquille sur mon cher enfant.	0.273913
The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door, and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of great exultation-- "I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than you are.	>> Elle alla frapper a la porte de son mari, et Anna l'entendit dire d'un ton joyeux : << Je vais avec vous, Charles, car je ne suis pas plus necessaire que vous ici.	0.240832
If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.	Si je m'enfermais toujours avec l'enfant, je n'aurais aucune influence sur lui.	0.182609
Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.	Anna restera : elle se charge d'en prendre soin. ~~~ Elle me l'a propose elle-meme.	-0.0315789
It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday."	Ainsi, je vais avec vous, ce qui sera beaucoup mieux, car je n'ai pas dine a Great-House depuis mardi.	0.337059
"This is very kind of Anne," was her husband's answer, "and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."	-- Anna est bien bonne, repondit son mari, je suis fort content que vous y alliez.	-0.0838235
Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening, when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits.		-0.3
They were gone, she hoped, to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.	Mais n'est-il pas bien dur de la laisser seule a la maison pour garder notre enfant malade ?	-0.0552632
She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?	>> Anna put alors plaider sa propre cause ; elle le fit de maniere a ne lui laisser aucun scrupule.	0.224339
She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.	Charles tacha d'obtenir, mais en vain, qu'elle vint les rejoindre le soir.	0.182609
Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.	Bientot elle eut le plaisir de les voir partir contents, quelque peu motive que fut leur bonheur.	0.232836
He must be either indifferent or unwilling.	Quant a elle, elle eprouvait autant de contentement qu'il lui etait donne d'en avoir jamais.	-0.0236842
Had he wished ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting.	Elle se savait indispensable a l'enfant, et que lui importait que Frederic Wenvorth se rendit agreable aux autres, a une demi-lieue de la ?	0.0564103
Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance, and their visit in general.	Elle se demandait s'il envisageait cette rencontre avec indifference, ou avec deplaisir.	0.273077
There had been music, singing, talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles.	S'il avait desire la revoir, il n'aurait pas attendu jusque-la, puisque les evenements lui avaient donne l'independance qui lui manquait d'abord. ~~~ Charles et Marie revinrent ravis de leur nouvelle connaissance et de leur soiree.	-0.00989848
He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore, somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him to breakfast at his father's.	On avait cause, chante, fait de la musique. ~~~ Le capitaine avait des manieres charmantes ; ni timidite, ni reserve ; il semblait etre une ancienne connaissance.	-0.174265
Anne understood it. ~~~ He wished to avoid seeing her.	Il devait, le lendemain, chasser avec Charles, et dejeuner avec lui a Great-House.	-0.0866667
He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.	Il s'etait informe d'Anna comme d'une personne qu'il aurait tres peu connue, voulant peut-etre, comme elle, echapper a une presentation quand ils se rencontreraient.	0.313007
The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice.		-0.3
Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the most consoling, that it would soon be over. ~~~ And it was soon over.	Anna et Marie etaient encore a table le lendemain matin, quand Charles vint pour chercher ses chiens.	-0.0317829
In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were in the drawing-room.	Ses soeurs le suivaient avec Wenvorth, qui avait voulu saluer Marie.	0.177966
Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it.	Celle-ci fut tres flattee de cette attention et enchantee de le recevoir, tandis qu'Anna etait agitee par mille sentiments dont le plus consolant etait qu'il ne resterait pas longtemps.	0.170886
Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen: the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.	Son regard rencontra celui du capitaine ; il fit de la tete un leger salut, puis il parla a Marie, dit quelques mots aux misses Musgrove ; un moment la chambre sembla animee et remplie ; puis Charles vint a la fenetre dire que tout etait pret.	0.324621
"It is over! ~~~ it is over!"	Anna resta seule, achevant de dejeuner comme elle put.	-0.156522
she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude.	<< C'est fini, se repetait-elle avec une joie nerveuse.	0.2625
"The worst is over!"	Le plus difficile est fait.	0.2
Mary talked, but she could not attend.		-0.3
She had seen him.	>> Elle l'avait vu !	0.26
They had met. ~~~ They had been once more in the same room.	Ils s'etaient trouves encore une fois dans la meme chambre !	-0.012766
Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.	Bientot, cependant, elle se raisonna, et s'efforca d'etre moins emue.	0.285246
Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.	Presque huit annees s'etaient ecoulees depuis que tout etait rompu.	0.289831
How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!	Combien il etait absurde de ressentir encore une agitation que le temps aurait du effacer !	0.410237
What might not eight years do?	Que de changements huit ans pouvaient apporter !	0.115385
Events of every description, changes, alienations, removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past-- how natural, how certain too!	tous resumes en un mot : l'oubli du passe !	-0.514286
It included nearly a third part of her own life.	C'etait presque le tiers de sa propre vie.	0.266667
Alas! ~~~ with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing.	Helas, il fallait bien le reconnaitre, pour des sentiments emprisonnes, ce temps n'est rien.	-0.01875
Now, how were his sentiments to be read?	Comment devait-elle interpreter les sentiments de Wenvorth ?	0.456863
Was this like wishing to avoid her?	Desirait-il l'eviter ?	0.171429
And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question.	Un moment apres, elle se haissait pour cette folle question.	0.747378
On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary:-- "Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so attentive to me.	Malgre toute sa sagesse, elle s'en faisait une autre, que Marie vint resoudre, en lui disant brusquement : << Le capitaine, qui a ete si attentif pour moi, n'a pas ete tres galant a votre egard, Anna.	0.0927273
Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they went away, and he said, 'You were so altered he should not have known you again.'"	Henriette lui a demande ce qu'il pensait de vous, et il a repondu qu'il ne vous aurait pas reconnue, que vous etiez changee.	0.273786
Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way, but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.	>> En general, Marie manquait d'egards pour sa soeur, mais cette fois elle ne soupconna pas quelle blessure elle lui faisait.	0.254717
"Altered beyond his knowledge."	<< Changee a ne pas me reconnaitre !...	0.258621
Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep mortification.	>> Elle se soumit en silence, mais profondement humiliee.	0.280851
Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse.	C'etait donc vrai ! ~~~ et elle ne pouvait pas lui rendre la pareille, car lui n'avait pas vieilli.	-0.00379747
She had already acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of her as he would. ~~~ No: the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.	Les annees qui avaient detruit la beaute de la jeune fille avaient donne a Wenvorth un regard plus brillant, un air plus male, plus ouvert, et n'avaient nullement diminue ses avantages physiques.	0.0131868
She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.	C'etait toujours le meme Frederic Wenvorth !	0.283784
"So altered that he should not have known her again!"		-0.3
These were words which could not but dwell with her.	<< Si changee qu'il ne l'aurait pas reconnue !	0.261538
Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them.	>> Ces mots ne pouvaient sortir de son esprit.	0.253846
They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.	Mais bientot elle fut bien aise de les avoir entendus : ils etaient faits pour la refroidir et calmer son agitation.	0.296875
Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but without an idea that they would be carried round to her.	Frederic ne pensait pas qu'on repeterait ses paroles ; il l'avait trouvee tristement changee et avait dit son impression.	0.297115
He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had spoken as he felt.		-0.3
He had not forgiven Anne Elliot. ~~~ She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident temper could not endure.	Il ne pardonnait pas a Anna Elliot ; elle l'avait rejete, abandonne, elle avait montre une faiblesse de caractere, que la nature confiante, decidee, du jeune homme ne supportait pas.	0.0401679
She had given him up to oblige others. ~~~ It had been the effect of over-persuasion.	Elle l'avait sacrifie pour satisfaire d'autres personnes.	-0.0519231
It had been weakness and timidity.	C'etait de la timidite et de la faiblesse.	0.24
He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.	Il avait eu pour elle un profond attachement et n'avait jamais vu depuis une femme qui l'egalat ; mais il n'entrait maintenant qu'un sentiment de curiosite dans le desir de la revoir.	0.288235
Her power with him was gone for ever.	Elle avait perdu pour toujours son pouvoir.	0.232258
It was now his object to marry.	Maintenant il etait riche et desirait se marier.	0.115385
He was rich, and being turned on shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.		-0.3
He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne Elliot.	Il etait pret a donner son coeur a toute jeune fille aimable qui se presenterait a lui, excepte Anna Elliot.	0.581905
This was his only secret exception, when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:-- "Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match. ~~~ Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.	Il disait a sa soeur : << Je demande une jeune fille entre quinze et trente ans ; un peu de beaute, quelques sourires, quelques flatteries pour les marins, et je suis un homme perdu.	0.0293893
A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man.	N'est-ce pas assez pour rendre aimable un homme qui n'a pas eu la societe des femmes ?	0.295775
Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?"		-0.3
He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.	>> Il disait cela pour etre contredit.	0.281818
His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with.	Son oeil fier et brillant disait qu'il se savait seduisant, et il ne pensait guere a Anna en designant ainsi la femme qu'il voudrait rencontrer : << Un esprit fort, uni a une grande douceur.	0.275172
"A strong mind, with sweetness of manner," made the first and the last of the description.	>> CHAPITRE VIII A dater de ce jour, le capitaine et Anna se trouverent souvent ensemble.	0.296
"That is the woman I want," said he. ~~~ "Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.	Ils dinerent chez M. Musgrove, car la sante de l'enfant ne pouvait pas servir plus longtemps de pretexte a sa tante.	0.0224638
If I am a fool, I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than most men."	Le passe devait sans doute se presenter souvent a leur memoire.	0.427778
Chapter 8 From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle.		-0.3
They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.	Des le premier soir la profession du capitaine l'amena a dire : << En telle annee......... avant d'embarquer...... >> etc. Sa voix ne tremblait pas, mais Anna etait sure qu'elle etait associee a son passe.	0.355426
Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth.	Autrefois, ils etaient tout l'un pour l'autre : maintenant plus rien. ~~~ Ils ne se parlaient pas, eux qui autrefois, au milieu de la plus nombreuse reunion, eussent trouve impossible de ne pas se parler !	-0.0794118
His profession qualified him, his disposition lead him, to talk; and "That was in the year six;" "That happened before I went to sea in the year six," occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.		-0.3
There must be the same immediate association of thought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.	Jamais, a l'exception de l'amiral et de sa femme, on n'eut trouve deux coeurs aussi unis qu'ils l'etaient autrefois.	0.29697
They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the commonest civility required.	Maintenant ils etaient moins que des etrangers l'un pour l'autre.	0.178947
Once so much to each other! ~~~ Now nothing!	Quand Frederic parlait, c'etait pour elle, la meme voix, le meme esprit.	-0.108333
There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another.	Ceux qui l'entouraient, etant tres ignorants des choses de la marine, lui faisaient mille questions.	0.12069
With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.	Les misses Musgrove etaient tout oreilles lorsqu'il decrivait la vie a bord, les repas, les occupations de chaque heure ; et leur surprise, en apprenant les arrangements et l'installation d'un navire, faisait surgir quelque plaisante reponse, qui rappelait a Anna le temps ou elle etait elle-meme ignorante de ces choses.	0.264344
Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted. ~~~ It was a perpetual estrangement.	Elle aussi avait ete plaisantee pour avoir cru qu'on vivait a bord sans provisions, sans cuisinier ni domestiques, et qu'on n'avait ni cuillers ni fourchettes.	-0.0337838
When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.	Un soupir de Mme Musgrove l'eveilla de sa reverie : << Ah !	0.23125
There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.		-0.3
From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying-- "Ah!	mademoiselle, lui dit-elle tout bas, si le ciel m'avait conserve mon pauvre fils, il serait un autre homme, aujourd'hui !	0.259223
Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare say he would have been just such another by this time."	>> Anna reprima un sourire, et ecouta patiemment Mme Musgrove, qui continua a soulager son coeur.	0.249398
Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore, could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.	Quand elle put donner son attention a ce qui se faisait autour d'elle, elle vit que les misses Musgrove avaient apporte la liste navale pour y chercher les noms des navires que le capitaine avait commandes.	0.45729
When she could let her attention take its natural course again, she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded. ~~~ "Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp." ~~~ "You will not find her there. ~~~ Quite worn out and broken up.		-0.3
I was the last man who commanded her.	<< Votre premier navire etait l'Aspic.	0.270968
Hardly fit for service then.	-- Vous ne le trouverez pas ici.	0.276
Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West Indies."	Il a ete use et demoli ; j'ai ete son dernier capitaine, alors qu'il etait presque hors de service.	0.413014
The girls looked all amazement.	Je fus envoye avec lui aux Indes orientales.	0.192857
"The Admiralty," he continued, "entertain themselves now and then, with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed. ~~~ But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed."	L'Amiraute s'amuse a envoyer de temps en temps quelques centaines d'hommes en mer dans un navire hors de service, mais comme elle en a beaucoup a surveiller, parmi les mille navires qui peuvent sombrer, il s'en trouve quelquefois un qui est encore bon.	-0.00657583
"Phoo!	-- Bah !	0.3
phoo!"	s'ecria l'amiral.	-0.128571
cried the Admiral, "what stuff these young fellows talk!	Quelles sornettes debitent ces jeunes gens !	0.223077
Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.	On ne vit jamais un meilleur sloop que l'Aspic dans son temps.	0.46
For an old built sloop, you would not see her equal.	Vous n'auriez pas trouve son egal, a ce vieux sloop !	0.293023
Lucky fellow to get her!	Frederic a ete un heureux garcon de l'avoir !	0.0571429
He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time.	Il fut demande par vingt personnes qui le meritaient mieux que lui.	0.184211
Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more interest than his."	Heureux garcon, de reussir si vite avec si peu de protection !	0.259615
"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth, seriously.	-- Je compris mon bonheur, amiral, je vous assure, repondit Wenvorth avec un grand serieux.	0.255882
"I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.	J'etais aussi content que vous pouvez le desirer.	0.230233
It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a very great object, I wanted to be doing something."	J'avais, dans ce temps-la, un grand motif pour m'embarquer. ~~~ J'avais besoin de faire quelque chose.	-0.00172414
"To be sure you did.	-- Vous avez raison.	0.282353
What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together?	Qu'est-ce qu'un jeune homme comme vous pouvait faire a terre pendant six grands mois ?	0.428814
If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again."	Si un homme n'est pas marie, il faut qu'il retourne bien vite en mer.	0.23617
"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you."	-- Capitaine Wenvorth, dit Louisa, vous avez du etre bien vexe, en montant sur l'Aspic, de voir quel vieux navire on vous avait donne ?	0.40467
"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;" said he, smiling.	-- Je savais d'avance ce qu'il etait, dit-il en riant.	0.228261
"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.	Je n'avais pas plus de decouvertes a faire que vous n'en auriez pour une vieille pelisse pretee a vos connaissances, de temps immemorial, et qui vous serait enfin pretee a vous-meme un jour de pluie.	0.220482
Ah!	Ah !	0.3
she was a dear old Asp to me.	c'etait mon cher vieil Aspic.	0.26087
She did all that I wanted.	Il faisait ce que je voulais.	0.259091
I knew she would. ~~~ I knew that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.		-0.3
I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.	Je savais que nous coulerions a fond ensemble, ou qu'il ferait ma fortune.	0.25
We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.	Je n'ai jamais eu avec lui deux jours de mauvais temps, et apres avoir pris bon nombre de corsaires, j'eus le bonheur d'accoster, l'ete suivant, la fregate francaise que je cherchais ; je la remorquai a Plymouth.	0.365388
	Par une autre bonne chance, nous n'etions pas depuis six heures dans le Sund, qu'un vent s'eleva qui aurait acheve notre pauvre Aspic.	-0.3
Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me."	Il dura quatre jours et quatre nuits. ~~~ Vingt-quatre heures plus tard, il ne serait reste du vaillant capitaine Wenvorth qu'un paragraphe dans les journaux, et, son navire n'etant qu'un sloop, personne n'y aurait fait attention.	0.040613
Anne's shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.	>> Anna fremit interieurement, mais les misses Musgrove purent exprimer librement leur pitie et leur horreur.	0.214737
"And so then, I suppose," said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if thinking aloud, "so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met with our poor boy.	<< C'est alors, sans doute, dit Mme Musgrove a voix basse, qu'il prit le commandement de la Laconia et prit a bord notre pauvre cher fils ?	0.375564

"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.	-- Ce fut a Gibraltar, ma mere.	0.605769
Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth."	Dick y etait reste malade avec une recommandation de son premier capitaine pour le capitaine Wenvorth.	0.469652
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend."	dites-lui qu'il ne craigne pas de nommer le pauvre Dick devant moi, car ce sera plutot un plaisir d'entendre parler de lui par un si bon ami.	0.337315
Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case, only nodded in reply, and walked away.	>> Charles, sans doute moins tranquille sur les consequences, repondit par un signe de tete et s'eloigna.	0.456667
The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had.	Les jeunes filles se mirent a chercher la Laconia, et le capitaine se donna le plaisir de la trouver lui-meme, ajoutant que c'etait un de ses meilleurs amis.	-0.0778626
"Ah!	<< Ah !	0.24

I shall never forget his happiness. ~~~ He felt it all, so much for her sake.	Je n'oublierai jamais combien il fut heureux a cause de sa femme.	-0.0190909
I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean."	J'aurais voulu qu'il fut la l'ete suivant, quand j'eus le meme bonheur dans la Mediterranee.	0.292208
"And I am sure, Sir," said Mrs Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us, when you were put captain into that ship.	-- Ce fut un beau jour pour nous, que celui ou vous futes nomme capitaine de ce navire, dit Mme Musgrove.	0.289535
We shall never forget what you did."	Nous n'oublierons jamais ce que vous avez fait.	0.203226
Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.	>> L'emotion lui coupait la voix, et Wenvorth, qui n'entendait qu'a demi, et ne songeait nullement a Dick, attendait la suite avec surprise.	0.186555
"My brother," whispered one of the girls; "mamma is thinking of poor Richard."	<< Maman pense a mon frere Richard, >> dit Louisa a voix basse.	0.213462
"Poor dear fellow!"	-- Pauvre cher enfant !	0.266667
continued Mrs Musgrove; "he was grown so steady, and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!	continua Mme Musgrove. ~~~ Il etait devenu si range, si bon sous vos ordres, et nous ecrivait de si bonnes lettres !	-0.00473684
Ah!	Ah !	0.3
it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.	plut a Dieu qu'il ne vous eut jamais quitte !	0.483538
I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you." ~~~ There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this speech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.	>> En entendant cela, une expression fugitive traversa la figure de Wenvorth : un pli de sa bouche et un certain regard convainquirent Anna qu'il n'etait pas de l'avis de Mme Musgrove, et qu'il avait eu probablement quelque peine a se debarrasser de Dick ; mais ce fut si rapide qu'elle seule s'en apercut.	-0.163261
They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. ~~~ It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.	Un instant apres, il etait serieux et maitre de lui ; il vint s'asseoir a cote de Mme Musgrove, et causa de son fils avec une grace naturelle qui temoignait de sa sympathie pour tout sentiment vrai.	-0.0197917
Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.	Anna etait assise a l'autre coin du divan, separee de lui par la vaste corpulence de Mme Musgrove, plus faite pour representer la bonne humeur et la bonne chere, que la tendresse et le sentiment, et tandis qu'Anna s'abritait derriere elle pour cacher son agitation, la facon dont le capitaine ecoutait les doleances de Mme Musgrove et ses larges soupirs n'etait pas sans merite.	0.335346
Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.	Le chagrin n'est pas necessairement en rapport avec la constitution.	0.28
A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.	Une grosse personne a aussi bien le droit d'etre affligee profondement que la plus gracieuse femme.	0.451765
But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.	Neanmoins, il y a des contrastes que la raison admet, mais qui froissent le gout et attirent le ridicule.	0.153409
The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with-- "If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters." ~~~ "Should I? ~~~ I am glad I was not a week later then."	L'amiral, apres avoir fait quelques tours dans la chambre, les mains derriere le dos, s'approcha de Wenvorth, et, tout a ses propres pensees, il lui dit, sans s'occuper s'il l'interrompait : << Si vous aviez ete une semaine plus tard a Lisbonne, Frederic, vous auriez eu a bord lady Marie Grierson et ses filles.	-0.0812238
The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.	-- Je suis heureux alors de n'avoir pas ete la.	0.276923
He defended himself; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few hours might comprehend.	>> L'amiral le plaisanta sur son manque de galanterie : il se defendit, tout en declarant qu'il n'admettrait jamais une femme a son bord, si ce n'est pour un bal, ou en visite.	0.382633
"But, if I know myself," said he, "this is from no want of gallantry towards them.		-0.3
It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.	<< Ce n'est point faute de galanterie, dit-il, mais par l'impossibilite d'avoir dans un navire le confortable necessaire aux femmes, et auquel elles ont droit.	0.297778
There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.		-0.3
I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it."	Je ne puis souffrir d'avoir une femme a bord, et aucun navire commande par moi n'en recevra jamais.	0.316931

"Nothing to the purpose," replied her brother. ~~~ "You were living with your husband, and were the only woman on board."	-- Il n'est pas question de cela, dit Frederic ; vous etiez avec votre mari, et la seule femme a bord.	-0.0325301
"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.	-- Mais vous avez bien pris, de Portsmouth a Plymouth, Mme Harville, sa soeur, sa cousine et trois enfants !	0.569123
Where was this superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?"	Ou etait donc alors votre superfine et extraordinaire galanterie ?	0.268966
"All merged in my friendship, Sophia. ~~~ I would assist any brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville's from the world's end, if he wanted it.	-- Absorbee dans mon amitie, Sophie ; je voulais etre utile a la femme d'un collegue, et j'aurais transporte au bout du monde tout ce que Harville aurait voulu.	-0.0146617
But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself."	Mais croyez bien que je regardais cela comme une chose facheuse.	0.263265
"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable."	-- Mon cher Frederic, ce que vous dites ne signifie rien.	0.3
"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.		-0.3

When he is married, if we have the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many others, have done.	Si nous avons le bonheur d'avoir une autre guerre, il fera comme nous, et sera reconnaissant qu'on lui amene sa femme.	0.269697

Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.	>> Mme Musgrove, qui ne connaissait pas un seul de ces noms, n'eut rien a repondre.	0.263427
"And I do assure you, ma'am," pursued Mrs Croft, "that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.	<< Je vous assure, madame, dit Mme Croft, que rien ne surpasse les commodites d'un navire de guerre ; j'entends celui d'un rang superieur.	0.396724
When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship.	Le plus heureux temps de ma vie a ete a bord. ~~~ J'etais avec mon mari, et, grace a Dieu, j'ai toujours eu une excellente sante ; aucun climat ne m'est mauvais.	0.0195055
While we were together, you know, there was nothing to be feared.	Je n'ai jamais connu le mal de mer.	0.0310345
Thank God! ~~~ I have always been blessed with excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.	La seule fois que j'ai souffert fut l'hiver que je passai seule a Deal, quand l'amiral etait dans les mers du Nord.	-0.0237805
A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew what sickness was afterwards.	N'ayant pas de nouvelles, je vivais dans de continuelles craintes et je ne savais que faire de mon temps.	0.2625
The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.	-- Oui, repondit Mme Musgrove, rien n'est si triste qu'une separation.	-0.354098
I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience." ~~~ "Aye, to be sure.		-0.3
Yes, indeed, oh yes!	Je le sais par moi-meme.	0.25
I am quite of your opinion, Mrs Croft," was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.	Quand M. Musgrove va aux assises, je ne suis tranquille que quand il est revenu.	0.275806
"There is nothing so bad as a separation.	>> On dansa pour terminer la soiree.	0.26129
	Anna offrit ses services, et fut heureuse de passer inapercue.	-0.3
I am quite of your opinion.	Ce fut une joyeuse soiree.	0.3
I know what it is, for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are over, and he is safe back again."		-0.3
The evening ended with dancing.	Le capitaine avait le plus d'entrain de tous.	0.182143
On its being proposed, Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.		-0.3
It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth.	Il etait l'objet des attentions et des deferences de tout le monde.	0.205263
She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of all the young women, could do.	Louise et Henriette semblaient si occupees de lui que, sans leur amitie reciproque, on eut pu les croire rivales.	0.209375
The Miss Hayters, the females of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.		-0.3
If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could wonder?	Quoi d'etonnant s'il etait un peu gate par de telles flatteries ?	0.201818
These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together, equally without error, and without consciousness.	Telles etaient les pensees d'Anna, tandis que ses doigts couraient machinalement sur le piano.	0.0182927
Once she felt that he was looking at herself, observing her altered features, perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?	Pendant un moment, elle sentit qu'il la regardait, qu'il observait ses traits alteres, cherchant peut-etre a y retrouver ce qui l'avait charme autrefois.	-0.0568182
The answer was, "Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.	Il demanda quelque chose ; elle entendit qu'on repondait : << Oh non !	0.271698
She had rather play. ~~~ She is never tired of playing." ~~~ Once, too, he spoke to her.	elle ne danse plus ; elle prefere jouer, et elle n'est jamais fatiguee.	-0.117647
She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.	>> Elle avait quitte le piano ; il prit sa place, essayant de noter un air dont il voulait donner une idee aux misses Musgrove.	0.357692
Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness-- "I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced to sit down again.	Elle s'approcha par hasard ; alors il se leva et avec une politesse etudiee : << Je vous demande pardon, mademoiselle, c'est votre place ; >> et malgre le refus d'Anna il se retira.	0.226654
Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.	Elle en avait assez !	-0.15
His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.	Cette froide et ceremonieuse politesse etait plus qu'elle n'en pouvait supporter.	0.245902
Chapter 9 Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's.	CHAPITRE IX Le capitaine Wenvorth etait venu a Kellynch comme chez lui, pour y rester autant qu'il lui plairait ; car il etait aime par l'amiral comme un frere.	0.472932
He had intended, on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off.	Il avait fait le projet d'aller voir son frere, dans le comte de Shrop, mais l'attrait d'Uppercross l'y fit renoncer.	0.133333
There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.	Il y avait tant d'amitie, de flatterie, quelque chose de si seduisant dans la reception qu'on lui faisait ; les parents etaient si hospitaliers, les enfants si aimables, qu'il ne put s'arracher de la.	0.239286
It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.	Bientot on le vit chaque jour a Uppercross.	0.259459
The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment.	Les Musgrove n'etaient pas plus empresses a l'inviter que lui a venir, surtout le matin, car l'amiral et sa femme sortaient toujours ensemble quand il n'y avait personne au chateau.	0.142568
Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies.	Ils s'interessaient a leur nouvelle propriete et visitaient leurs prairies, leurs bestiaux, ou faisaient volontiers un tour en voiture.	0.206667
It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.	L'intimite du capitaine etait a peine etablie a Uppercross, quand Charles Hayter y revint, et en prit ombrage. ~~~ Charles Hayter etait l'aine des cousins.	0.234492
Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable, pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's introduction.	C'etait un tres aimable et agreable jeune homme, et jusqu'a l'arrivee de Wenvorth, un grand attachement semblait exister entre lui et Henriette.	0.15
He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's house, only two miles from Uppercross.	Il etait dans les ordres, mais sa presence n'etant pas exigee a la cure, il vivait chez son pere a une demi-lieue d'Uppercross.	0.357075
A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period, and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners, and of seeing Captain Wentworth.	Une courte absence avait prive Henriette de ses attentions, et en revenant il vit avec chagrin qu'on avait pris sa place.	0.239305
Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters. ~~~ They had each had money, but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence.	Mme Musgrove et Mme Hayter etaient soeurs, mais leur mariage leur avait fait une position tres differente.	0.145833
Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.		-0.3
The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their cousins.	Tandis que les Musgrove etaient les premiers de la contree, la vie mesquine et retiree des Hayter, l'education peu soignee des enfants, les auraient places en dehors de la societe sans leurs relations avec Uppercross.	0.293478
Charles's attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.	Le fils aine etait seul excepte ; il etait tres superieur a sa famille comme manieres et culture d'esprit.	0.293258
"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,"-- and Henrietta did seem to like him.	Les deux familles avaient toujours ete dans des termes excellents, car d'un cote il n'y avait pas d'orgueil ; de l'autre, pas d'envie.	0.210345
Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.	Les misses Musgrove avaient seulement une conscience de leur superiorite qui leur faisait patronner leurs cousines avec plaisir.	0.3
Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.	Henriette semblait avoir oublie son cousin ; on se demandait si elle etait aimee du capitaine.	0.20625
Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him.	Laquelle des deux soeurs preferait-il ? ~~~ Henriette etait peut-etre plus jolie, Louise plus intelligente.	-0.0870968
Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance.	Les parents, soit ignorance du monde, soit confiance dans la prudence de leurs filles, semblaient laisser tout au hasard et ne se preoccuper de rien. ~~~ Au cottage, c'etait different.	-0.0193548
There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage: the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.		-0.3
Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.	Le jeune menage semblait plus dispose a faire des conjectures, et Anna eut bientot a ecouter leurs opinions sur la preference de Wenvorth.	0.275
Charles "had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.	Charles penchait pour Louise, Marie pour Henriette, et tous les deux s'accordaient a dire qu'un mariage avec l'une ou avec l'autre serait extremement desirable.	0.49
Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.	Wenvorth avait du, d'apres ses propres paroles, gagner 50 000 livres pendant la guerre ; c'etait une fortune, et s'il survenait une autre guerre, il etait homme a se distinguer.	0.346439
Oh!	<< Dieu !	0
it would be a capital match for either of his sisters."	s'ecriait Marie, s'il allait s'elever aux plus grands honneurs !	0.234783
"Upon my word it would," replied Mary.	S'il etait cree baronnet !	0.169565
"Dear me!	Lady Wenvorth !	0.133333
If he should rise to any very great honours!		-0.3
If he should ever be made a baronet!	cela sonne tres bien.	0.126316
'Lady Wentworth' sounds very well.	Quelle chance pour Henriette.	0.255556
That would be a noble thing, indeed, for Henrietta!		-0.3
She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not dislike that.	C'est elle qui prendrait ma place en ce cas, et cela ne lui deplairait pas.	0.499031
Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!		-0.3
It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."	Mais apres tout, ce ne serait qu'une nouvelle noblesse, et je n'en fais pas grand cas.	0.3
It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to.	>> Marie aurait voulu qu'Henriette fut preferee pour mettre fin aux pretentions de Hayter.	0.134615
She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.		-0.3
"You know," said she, "I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away.	Elle regardait comme une veritable infortune pour elle et pour ses enfants que de nouveaux liens de parente s'etablissent avec cette famille.	0.238017
I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them.	<< Si l'on considere, disait-elle, les alliances que les Musgrove ont faites, Henriette n'a pas le droit de dechoir, et de faire un choix desagreable aux personnes principales de sa famille, en leur donnant des allies d'une condition inferieure.	0.232941
And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?	Qui est Charles Hayter, je vous prie ?	0.697537
Nothing but a country curate.	Rien qu'un ministre de campagne.	0.265385
A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross."	C'est un mariage tres inferieur pour miss Musgrove d'Uppercross.	0.54375
Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw things as an eldest son himself.	>> Son mari ne partageait pas son avis, car son cousin, qu'il aimait beaucoup, etait un fils aine, et avait ainsi droit a sa consideration.	0.57374
"Now you are talking nonsense, Mary," was therefore his answer.	<< Vous etes absurde, Marie, disait-il.	0.128571
"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property.	Charles Hayter a beaucoup de chance d'obtenir quelque chose de l'eveque ; et puis, il est fils aine, et il heritera d'une jolie propriete.	0.224483
The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country.	L'etat de Winthrop n'a pas moins de deux cent cinquante acres, outre la ferme de Tauton, une des meilleures de la contree.	0.507928
I grant you, that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.		-0.3
No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."	Charles est un bon garcon, et quand il aura Winthrop, il vivra autrement qu'aujourd'hui.	0.306579
"Charles may say what he pleases," cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has.		-0.3
She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.	Un homme qui a une telle propriete n'est pas a dedaigner.	0.3
I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.	Non, Henriette pourrait trouver plus mal.	0.283784
And as to Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.	Si elle epouse Hayter, et que Louisa puisse avoir Wenvorth, je serai tres satisfait.	0.279167
But Charles is so positive! ~~~ I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me."		-0.3
A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition in little Charles.	>> Cette conversation avait lieu le lendemain d'un diner a Uppercross : Anna etait restee a la maison sous le pretexte d'une migraine, et avait eu le double avantage d'eviter Wenvorth et de ne pas etre prise pour arbitre.	0.37337
She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.	Elle aurait voulu que le capitaine se decidat vite, car elle sympathisait avec les souffrances de Hayter, pour qui tout etait preferable a cette incertitude.	0.393785
As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.		-0.3
Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife.	Il avait ete tres froisse et tres inquiet des facons de sa cousine.	0.192857
With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alteration could not be understood too soon.		-0.3
Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin's behaviour.	Pouvait-il si vite etre devenu pour elle un etranger ? ~~~ Il n'avait ete absent que deux dimanches.	-0.0182432
She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross: but there was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.		-0.3
He had been absent only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.		-0.3
It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.	Quand il etait parti, elle s'interessait a son changement de cure, pour obtenir celle d'Uppercross du Dr Shirley, malade et infirme.	0.207321
The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.		-0.3
When he came back, alas!	Quand il revint, helas !	0.3
the zeal of the business was gone by.	tout interet avait disparu.	0.228
Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.		-0.3
"Well, I am very glad indeed: but I always thought you would have it; I always thought you sure.	Il raconta ses demarches, et Henriette ne lui preta qu'une oreille distraite.	0.246269
It did not appear to me that--in short, you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.		-0.3
Is he coming, Louisa?"	Elle semblait avoir oublie toute cette affaire.	-0.03
One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.	Un matin, le capitaine entra dans le salon du cottage, ou Anna etait seule avec le petit malade couche sur le divan.	-0.025
The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived his manners of their usual composure: he started, and could only say, "I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here," before he walked to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.	La surprise de la trouver seule le priva de sa presence d'esprit habituelle, il tressaillit. ~~~ << Je croyais les misses Musgrove ici ; >> puis il alla vers la fenetre pour se remettre et decider quelle attitude il prendrait.	-0.00256684
"They are up stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few moments, I dare say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.	<< Elles sont en haut avec ma soeur, et vont bientot descendre, >> repondit Anna toute confuse. ~~~ Si l'enfant ne l'avait pas appelee, elle serait sortie pour delivrer le capitaine aussi bien qu'elle-meme.	-0.0745665
He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, "I hope the little boy is better," was silent.	Il resta a la fenetre, et apres avoir poliment demande des nouvelles du petit garcon, il garda le silence.	0.283146
She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule.	Anna s'agenouilla devant l'enfant, qui lui demandait quelque chose, et ils resterent ainsi quelques instants, quand, a sa grande satisfaction, elle vit entrer quelqu'un.	0.466531
She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.	C'etait Charles Hayter, qui ne fut guere plus content de trouver la le capitaine, que celui-ci ne l'avait ete d'y trouver Anna.	0.0995937
She only attempted to say, "How do you do?	Tout ce qu'elle put dire fut : << Comment vous portez-vous ?	0.171429
Will you not sit down?	Veuillez vous asseoir.	0.268421
The others will be here presently."	Mon frere et ma soeur vont descendre.	0.290323
Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.	>> Wenvorth quitta la fenetre et parut dispose a causer avec Hayter, mais, voyant celui-ci prendre un journal, il retourna a la fenetre.	0.0313043
Another minute brought another addition. ~~~ The younger boy, a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.	Bientot la porte restee entr'ouverte fut poussee par l'autre petit garcon, enfant de deux ans, decide et hardi.	-0.224211
There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.	Il alla au divan et reclama une friandise ; comme il ne s'en trouvait pas la, il demanda un jouet ; il s'accrocha a la robe de sa tante, et elle ne put s'en debarrasser.	0.246569
She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain. ~~~ Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.	Elle pria, ordonna, voulut le repousser, mais l'enfant trouvait grand plaisir a grimper sur son dos : << Walter, otez-vous, mechant enfant, je suis tres mecontente de vous.	-0.00308219
"Walter," said she, "get down this moment.		-0.3
You are extremely troublesome.		-0.3
I am very angry with you."		-0.3
"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?	-- Walter, cria Charles Hayter, pourquoi n'obeissez-vous pas ?	0.9
Do not you hear your aunt speak?	Entendez-vous votre tante ?	0.276
Come to me, Walter, come to cousin Charles."	Venez pres de moi, Walter, venez pres du cousin Charles.	0.887719
But not a bit did Walter stir.	>> Walter ne bougea pas.	0.742857
In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being released from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.	Tout a coup, elle se trouva debarrassee. ~~~ Quelqu'un enlevait l'enfant, detachait les petites mains qui entouraient le cou d'Anna, et emportait le petit garcon avant qu'elle sut que c'etait le capitaine.	-0.0741379
Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless. ~~~ She could not even thank him.	Elle ne put dire un mot pour le remercier, tant ses sensations etaient tumultueuses.	0.103636
She could only hang over little Charles, with most disordered feelings. ~~~ His kindness in stepping forward to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares, and leave the room. ~~~ She could not stay.	L'action du capitaine, la maniere silencieuse dont il l'avait accomplie, le bruit qu'il fit ensuite en jouant avec l'enfant pour eviter les remerciements et toute conversation avec elle, tout cela donna a Anna une telle confusion de pensees qu'elle ne put se remettre, et, voyant entrer Marie et les misses Musgrove, elle se hata de quitter la chambre.	-0.110639
It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.	Si elle etait restee, c'etait la l'occasion d'etudier les quatre personnes qui s'y trouvaient.	0.160976
It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth.	Il etait evident que Charles Hayter n'avait aucune sympathie pour Wenvorth.	1.02273
She had a strong impression of his having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's interference, "You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;" and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.	Elle se souvint qu'il avait dit au petit Walter, d'un ton vexe, apres l'intervention du capitaine : << Il fallait m'obeir, Walter ; je vous avais dit de ne pas tourmenter votre tante. ~~~ >> Il etait donc mecontent que Wenvorth eut fait ce qu'il aurait du faire lui-meme ?	-0.0127803
But neither Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better arranged her own.	Mais elle ne pouvait guere s'interesser aux sentiments des autres, avant d'avoir mis un peu d'ordre dans les siens.	0.260204
She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her.	Elle etait honteuse d'elle-meme, humiliee d'etre si agitee, si abattue pour une bagatelle ; mais cela etait, et il lui fallut beaucoup de solitude et de reflexion pour se remettre.	0.394801
Chapter 10 Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.	CHAPITRE X Les occasions ne manquerent pas pour faire de nouvelles remarques.	0.28209
Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home, where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.	Elle avait vu assez souvent les deux jeunes gens et les deux jeunes filles ensemble pour avoir une opinion, mais elle etait trop sage pour la laisser voir a la maison.	-0.0236413
They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.	Elle n'aurait satisfait ni le mari ni la femme.	0.24
It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with some.	Elle supposait que Louisa etait preferee a sa soeur, mais sa memoire et son experience lui disaient que le capitaine n'eprouvait d'amour ni pour l'une ni pour l'autre.	0.187215
Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.	Le sentiment qu'elles avaient pour lui etait peut-etre plus vif ; c'etait de l'admiration qui pouvait devenir de l'amour.	0.288
Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.	Cependant quelquefois Henriette semblait indecise entre Hayter et Wenvorth.	0.0617647
She did not attribute guile to any.		-0.3
It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning.	Anna eut voulu les eclairer tous sur leur situation, et leur montrer les maux auxquels ils s'exposaient.	0.25618
There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner. ~~~ He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter.	Elle n'attribuait a aucun d'eux une mauvaise pensee, et se disait avec joie que le capitaine ne se doutait pas du mal qu'il causait ; il n'avait aucune fatuite et ne connaissait pas sans doute les projets de Hayter.	-0.0782051
He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.	Seulement il avait tort d'accepter les attentions des deux jeunes filles.	0.4375
After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.	Bientot cependant Hayter sembla abandonner la place.	0.572872
Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a most decided change.	Trois jours se passerent sans qu'on le vit ; il refusa meme une invitation a diner.	0.491304
He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large books before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.	M. Musgrove l'ayant trouve chez lui entoure de gros livres en avait conclu qu'il usait sa sante au travail.	0.04
It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to-morrow.	Marie pensait qu'il etait positivement refuse par Henriette, tandis que son mari, au contraire, l'attendait chaque jour. ~~~ Enfin Anna l'approuvait de s'absenter.	-0.00215827
Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise.	Vers cette epoque, par une belle matinee de novembre, Charles Musgrove et le capitaine etaient a la chasse.	0.265116
One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion-house.	Anna et Marie, tranquillement assises, travaillaient au cottage, quand les misses Musgrove passerent et, s'approchant de la fenetre, dirent qu'elles allaient faire une promenade, trop longue pour Marie.	0.371062
It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes, I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;" Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be communicated, and everything being to be done together, however undesired and inconvenient.	Celle-ci, un peu choquee, repondit : << Mais si ! ~~~ j'irais volontiers, j'aime les longues promenades. ~~~ >> Anna vit aux regards des jeunes filles que c'etait la precisement ce qu'elles ne voulaient pas, et admira de nouveau cette habitude de famille qui mettait dans la necessite de tout dire et de tout faire ensemble, sans le desirer.	-0.241667
She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the interference in any plan of their own.	Elle tacha de dissuader Marie d'y aller ; mais, n'y reussissant pas, elle pensa qu'il valait mieux accepter aussi, pour elle-meme, l'invitation beaucoup plus cordiale des misses Musgrove, car sa presence pouvait etre utile pour retourner avec sa soeur et ne pas entraver leurs plans.	0.3
"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk," said Mary, as she went up stairs.	<< Qui leur fait supposer que je ne puis faire une longue promenade ? ~~~ disait Marie en montant l'escalier.	-0.00340909
"Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased, if we had refused to join them.	On semble croire que je ne suis pas bonne marcheuse, et cependant elles n'auraient pas ete contentes si j'avais refuse.	0.276238
When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"	Quand on vient ainsi vous demander quelque chose, est-ce qu'on peut dire : Non ?...	0.4375
Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.	>> Au moment ou elles se mettaient en route, les chasseurs revinrent.	0.223404
They had taken out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.	Ils avaient emmene un jeune chien qui avait gate leur chasse et avance leur retour.	0.3
Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.	Ils etaient donc tout disposes a se promener. ~~~ Si Anna avait pu le prevoir, elle serait restee a la maison.	-0.025
Could Anne have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance.	Elle se dit qu'il etait trop tard pour reculer, et ils partirent tous les six dans la direction choisie par les misses Musgrove, Quand le chemin devenait plus etroit, Anna s'arrangeait pour marcher avec son frere et sa soeur ; elle ne voulait pas gener les autres.	0.364726
Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep with her brother and sister.		-0.3
Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.	Son plaisir a elle etait l'air et l'exercice, la vue des derniers rayons de soleil sur les feuilles jaunies ; et aussi de se repeter tout bas quelques-unes des poetiques descriptions de l'automne, saison qui a une si puissante influence sur les ames delicates et tendres.	0.221492
She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves, she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.	Tout en occupant son esprit de ces reveries, de ces citations, il lui fut impossible de ne pas entendre la conversation du capitaine avec les deux soeurs.	0.188538
It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing, might fall into.	C'etait un simple bavardage anime, comme il convient a des jeunes gens sur un pied d'intimite.	0.288312
He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.	Il causait plus avec Louisa qu'avec Henriette.	0.645732
Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.	La premiere y mettait plus d'entrain que l'autre.	0.209302
This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech of Louisa's which struck her.	Elle dit quelque chose qui frappa Anna.	-0.105882
After one of the many praises of the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added:-- "What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!	Apres avoir admire a plusieurs reprises cette splendide journee, le capitaine ajouta : << Quel beau temps pour l'amiral et pour ma soeur !	0.24569
They meant to take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills.	Ils font ce matin une longue promenade en voiture : nous pourrons les voir en haut de ces collines.	0.288608
They talked of coming into this side of the country.	Ils ont dit qu'ils viendraient de ce cote.	0.233333
I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.	Je me demande ou ils verseront aujourd'hui ?	0.292105
Oh!	Ah !	0.3
it does happen very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as lieve be tossed out as not." ~~~ "Ah!	cela leur arrive souvent ; mais ma soeur ne s'en preoccupe pas.	-0.118868
You make the most of it, I know," cried Louisa, "but if it were really so, I should do just the same in her place.	-- Pour moi, dit Louisa, a sa place j'en ferais autant.	0.256522
If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else."	Si j'aimais quelqu'un comme elle aime l'amiral, rien ne pourrait m'en separer, et j'aimerais mieux etre versee par lui que menee en surete par un autre.	0.250781
It was spoken with enthusiasm. ~~~ "Had you?"	>> Cela fut dit avec enthousiasme.	-0.0166667
cried he, catching the same tone; "I honour you!"	<< Vraiment, s'ecria-t-il, du meme ton.	0.24
And there was silence between them for a little while.	Je vous admire. ~~~ >> Puis il y eut un silence.	-0.0315789
Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again. ~~~ The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet, fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together, blessed her memory.	Anna oublia un instant les citations poetiques des douces scenes de l'automne ; il ne lui resta a la memoire qu'un tendre sonnet rempli des descriptions de l'annee expirante emportant avec elle le bonheur et les images de jeunesse, d'espoir et de printemps.	0.0934571
She roused herself to say, as they struck by order into another path, "Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?"	Voyant qu'on prenait un autre sentier : << N'est-ce pas le chemin de Wenthrop ?	0.181818
But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.	>> dit-elle. ~~~ Mais personne ne l'entendit.	-0.0230769
Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.	On se dirigeait en effet vers Wenthrop, et apres une montee douce a travers de grands enclos, ou la charrue du laboureur, preparant un nouveau printemps, dementait les poesies melancoliques, on gagna le sommet d'une haute colline qui separait Uppercross de Wenthrop.	0.213285
Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them; an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard.	Wenthrop, qu'on apercut alors en bas, etait une laide et vulgaire maison, a toit peu eleve, entouree de granges et de batiments de ferme.	0.352174
Mary exclaimed, "Bless me!	<< Est-ce la Wenthrop ?	0.24
here is Winthrop. ~~~ I declare I had no idea!	dit Marie, je n'en avais aucune idee.	-0.0234375
Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."	Je crois que nous ferons mieux de retourner.	0.157895
Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary wished; but "No!"		-0.3
said Charles Musgrove, and "No, no!"	Je suis tres fatiguee.	0.12
cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing the matter warmly. ~~~ Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently, though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.	>> Henriette, un peu mal a l'aise, et n'apercevant pas Charles Hayter aux environs, etait prete a faire ce que Marie desirait, mais Charles Musgrove dit non, et Louisa dit non, avec plus d'energie encore, et, prenant sa soeur a part, elle parut discuter vivement.	-0.0190909
But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, "Oh! ~~~ no, indeed!	Charles declara d'une facon tres nette qu'il irait voir sa tante, puisqu'il en etait si pres, et il s'efforca de persuader sa femme ; mais c'etait un des points sur lesquels elle montrait sa volonte : elle refusa absolument, et tout dans sa figure indiquait qu'elle n'irait pas.	-0.0113571
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good;" and, in short, her look and manner declared, that go she would not.	Apres un court debat, il fut convenu que Charles et Henriette descendraient la colline, et que les autres resteraient en haut.	0.235514
After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations, it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill.	Marie saisit un moment pour dire au capitaine, en jetant autour d'elle un regard meprisant : << C'est bien desagreable d'avoir des parents semblables ; je n'y suis pas allee deux fois dans ma vie.	0.174847
Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying to Captain Wentworth-- "It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!		-0.3
But, I assure you, I have never been in the house above twice in my life."	>> Il eut un sourire de commande, et se detourna avec un regard de mepris, qu'Anna vit parfaitement.	0.18
She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile, followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of.	Louisa, qui avait fait quelques pas avec Henriette, les rejoignit, et Marie s'assit sur un tronc d'arbre.	0.14
The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also.		-0.3
She turned through the same gate, but could not see them. ~~~ Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.	Tant qu'on fut autour d'elle, elle fut contente, mais quand Louisa se fut eloignee avec Wenvorth pour cueillir des noisettes, elle trouva son siege mauvais, et alla a sa recherche.	0.00183537
Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on till she overtook her.	Anna s'assit sur un talus, et entendit derriere elle Wenvorth et Louisa, qui se frayaient un passage dans une haie.	0.22268
Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the centre.	Louisa semblait tres animee et disait : << Je l'ai fait partir ; je trouvais absurde qu'elle ne fit pas cette visite.	0.176827
They were speaking as they drew near. ~~~ Louisa's voice was the first distinguished.	Ce n'est pas moi qui me laisserais influencer pour faire ce que je ne veux pas.	-0.0161538
She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech.		-0.3
What Anne first heard was-- "And so, I made her go.	Quand j'ai decide quelque chose, je le fais.	0.268421
I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense.		-0.3
What! ~~~ would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right, by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?	Henriette allait renoncer a aller a Wenthrop par une complaisance ridicule.	0.0863636
No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.	-- Alors, sans vous, elle n'y serait pas allee ?	0.3
When I have made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"		-0.3
"She would have turned back then, but for you?"	-- Mais oui, j'ai honte de le dire.	0.186207
"She would indeed. ~~~ I am almost ashamed to say it."	-- Elle est bien heureuse d'avoir aupres d'elle un caractere tel que le votre.	-0.075
"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!	Ce que vous venez de dire confirme mes observations.	0.286047
After the hints you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last time I was in company with him, I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on.	Je ne veux pas feindre d'ignorer ce dont il s'agit : je vois que cette visite est autre chose qu'une simple visite de politesse.	0.181132
I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.	Si votre soeur ne sait pas resister a une demande quelconque dans une circonstance si peu importante, je les plains tous deux quand il s'agira de choses graves demandant force et fermete.	0.18645
Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness, I see. ~~~ If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can.	Votre soeur est une aimable personne, mais vous etes ferme et decidee : si vous voulez la diriger pour son bonheur, donnez-lui autant de votre caractere que vous pourrez.	-0.0146853
But this, no doubt, you have been always doing.	Mais vous l'avez sans doute toujours fait.	0.275676
It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.	Le pire des maux est un caractere faible et indecis sur lequel on ne peut compter.	0.198529
You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody may sway it.	On n'est jamais sur qu'une bonne impression sera durable. ~~~ Que ceux qui veulent etre heureux soient fermes.	0.105
Let those who would be happy be firm.	>> Il cueillit une noisette.	0.228
Here is a nut," said he, catching one down from an upper bough, "to exemplify: a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has outlived all the storms of autumn.	<< Voici, dit-il, une noisette belle et saine qui a resiste aux tempetes de l'automne.	0.166952
Not a puncture, not a weak spot anywhere.	Pas une tache, pas une piqure.	0.196154
This nut," he continued, with playful solemnity, "while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of."	Tandis que ses soeurs ont ete foulees aux pieds, cette noisette, dit-il avec une solennite burlesque, est encore en possession de tout le bonheur auquel une noisette peut pretendre.	0.359091
Then returning to his former earnest tone--"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.	>> Puis, revenant au ton serieux : << Mon premier souhait pour ceux que j'aime est la fermete.	0.219231
If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind."	Si Louisa Musgrove veut etre belle et heureuse a l'automne de sa vie, elle cultivera toutes les forces de son ame.	0.550622
He had done, and was unanswered.	>> Il ne recut pas de reponse.	0.264
It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech: words of such interest, spoken with such serious warmth!	Anna eut ete surprise que Louisa put repondre promptement a des paroles temoignant un si vif interet.	0.525194
She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.	Elle comprenait ce que Louisa ressentait.	0.728571
For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.		-0.3
While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her, and they were moving on.	Quant a elle, elle n'osait bouger, de peur d'etre vue.	0.390119
Before they were beyond her hearing, however, Louisa spoke again.	Un buisson de houx la protegeait.	0.0103448
"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects," said she; "but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot pride.	Ils s'eloignerent : elle entendit Louisa, qui disait : << Marie a un assez bon naturel, mais elle m'irrite quelquefois par sa deraison et son orgueil.	0.292857
She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.	Elle en a beaucoup trop, de l'orgueil des Elliot !	0.838137
We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.	Nous aurions tant desire que Charles epousat Anna au lieu de Marie.	0.484091
I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?"	Vous savez qu'il a demande Anna ?	0.203571
After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said-- "Do you mean that she refused him?"	>> Le capitaine repondit apres un silence : << Voulez-vous dire qu'elle l'a refuse ?	0.295775
"Oh! ~~~ yes; certainly."	-- Oui, certainement.	-0.015
"When did that happen?"	-- A quelle epoque ?	0.229412
"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time; but I believe about a year before he married Mary.	-- Je ne sais pas au juste, car nous etions en pension alors.	0.006
I wish she had accepted him.	Je crois que ce fut un an avant d'epouser Marie.	0.1
We should all have liked her a great deal better; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's doing, that she did not.		-0.3
They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him."	Mes parents pensent que sa grande amie, lady Russel, empecha ce mariage, elle ne trouva pas Charles assez lettre, et persuada a Anna de refuser.	0.412069
The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.	>> Les voix s'eloignerent, et Anna n'entendit plus rien.	0.281633
Her own emotions still kept her fixed. ~~~ She had much to recover from, before she could move.	D'abord immobile d'etonnement, elle eut beaucoup de peine a se lever.	-0.045
The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal of very painful import.	Elle n'avait point eu le sort de ceux qui ecoutent : on n'avait dit d'elle aucun mal ; mais elle avait entendu des choses tres penibles.	0.278571
She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation.	Elle vit comment elle etait jugee par le capitaine ; et il avait eu, en parlant d'elle, un melange de curiosite et d'interet qui l'agitait extremement.	0.224409
As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once more in motion together.		-0.3
Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give.	Elle rejoignit Marie, et quand toute la compagnie fut reunie, elle eprouva quelque soulagement a s'isoler au milieu de tous.	0.103125
Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured, Charles Hayter with them.	Charles et Henriette ramenerent Hayter avec eux.	0.798837
The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.	Anna ne chercha pas a comprendre ce qui s'etait passe, mais il etait certain qu'il y avait eu du froid entre eux, et que maintenant ils semblaient tres heureux, quoique Henriette parut un peu confuse.	0.21986
Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter exceedingly happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.	Des ce moment, ils s'occuperent exclusivement l'un de l'autre. ~~~ Maintenant tout designait Louisa pour le capitaine, et ils marchaient aussi cote a cote.	-0.0477273
Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.	Dans la vaste prairie que les promeneurs traversaient, ils formaient trois groupes. ~~~ Anna appartenait au moins anime des trois.	-0.0864865
In a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.	Elle rejoignit Charles et Marie et se trouva assez fatiguee pour accepter le bras de son beau-frere, qui etait alors mecontent de sa femme.	0.0871795
She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.	Marie s'etait montree peu aimable et en subissait en ce moment les consequences.	-0.0130435
Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.		-0.3
This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit, the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.	Son mari lui quittait le bras a chaque instant pour couper avec sa cravache des tetes d'orties le long de la haie : elle se plaignit selon son habitude, mais Charles les quittant toutes deux pour courir apres une belette, elles purent a peine le suivre.	0.404693
He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.	Au sortir de la prairie, ils furent rejoints par la voiture de l'amiral, qui s'avancait dans la meme direction qu'eux.	0.108197
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.	Apprenant la longue course qu'avaient entreprise les jeunes gens, il offrit obligeamment une place a celle des dames qui serait la plus fatiguee.	0.318548
The invitation was general, and generally declined.	Il pouvait lui eviter un mille, puisqu'ils passaient par Uppercross.	0.208696
The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.	L'invitation fut refusee par les misses Musgrove, qui n'etaient pas fatiguees, et par Marie, qui fut offensee de n'avoir pas ete demandee avant toute autre, ou parce que l'orgueil des Elliot, comme disait Louisa, ne pouvait accepter d'etre en tiers dans une voiture a un seul cheval.	0.256312
The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again, when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister.	On allait se separer, quand le capitaine dit tout bas quelques mots a sa soeur.	-0.0443182
The something might be guessed by its effects.	<< Miss Elliot, dit celle-ci, vous devez etre fatiguee : laissez-nous le plaisir de vous reconduire.	-0.045
"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired," cried Mrs Croft.	Il y a largement place pour trois ; si nous etions aussi minces que vous, on pourrait tenir quatre.	0.0765957
"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.	Venez, je vous en prie.	0
Here is excellent room for three, I assure you.	>> L'hesitation n'etait pas permise a Anna.	0.284211
If we were all like you, I believe we might sit four.	L'amiral insista aussi.	0.0136364
You must, indeed, you must."	Refuser etait impossible.	0.2875
Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline, she was not allowed to proceed.	Le capitaine se tourna vers elle, et, sans dire un mot, l'aida tranquillement a monter en voiture.	0.274699
The Admiral's kind urgency came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.		-0.3
Yes; he had done it.	Oui, il avait fait cela !	0.229412
She was in the carriage, and felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give her rest.	Elle etait la, assise par la volonte et les mains de Frederic !	-0.294231
She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.	Il avait vu sa fatigue, et avait voulu qu'elle se reposat.	0.0428571
This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.	Elle fut touchee de cette manifestation de ses sentiments.	0.217647
She understood him.	Elle comprit sa pensee.	0.25
He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling.	Il ne pouvait pas lui pardonner, mais il ne voulait pas qu'elle souffrit.	0.204255
Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief.		-0.3
It was a remainder of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.	Il y etait pousse par un sentiment d'affection qu'il ne s'avouait pas a lui-meme.	-0.182609
Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given.	Elle ne pouvait y penser sans un melange de joie et de chagrin.	0.126923
They had travelled half their way along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.	Elle repondit d'abord distraitement aux bienveillantes remarques de ses compagnons.	0.264
She then found them talking of "Frederick."	On etait a moitie chemin, quand elle s'apercut qu'on parlait de Frederic !	0.102632
"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy," said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.	<< Il veut certainement epouser l'une des deux, dit l'amiral ; mais cela ne nous dit pas laquelle.	0.245122
He has been running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.	-- Il y va depuis assez longtemps pour savoir ce qu'il veut.	0.168
Ay, this comes of the peace.	C'est la paix qui est cause de tout cela.	0.175
If it were war now, he would have settled it long ago.	Si la guerre eclatait, il serait bientot decide.	0.285714
We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war.	Nous autres marins, miss Elliot, nous ne pouvons pas faire longtemps notre cour en temps de guerre.	0.418182
How many days was it, my dear, between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?"	Combien s'ecoula-t-il de temps, ma chere, entre notre premiere entrevue et notre installation a Yarmouth ?	0.234783
"We had better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly; "for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.	-- Nous ferons mieux de n'en rien dire, dit gaiment Mme Croft, car si miss Elliot savait combien ce fut vite fait, elle ne croirait jamais que nous ayons pu etre heureux.	0.41539
I had known you by character, however, long before."	Cependant je vous connaissais de reputation longtemps auparavant.	0.206667
"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we to wait for besides?	-- Et moi j'avais entendu parler de vous comme d'une jolie fille. ~~~ Fallait-il attendre davantage ?	-0.0270833
I do not like having such things so long in hand.	Je n'aime pas a avoir longtemps de pareils projets en tete.	0.225
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch.	Je voudrais que Frederic decouvrit ses batteries, et amenat une de ces jeunes misses a Kellynch.	0.620014
Then there would always be company for them.	Elles trouveraient de la compagnie.	0.24375
And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly know one from the other."	Elles sont charmantes toutes deux, je les distingue a peine l'une de l'autre.	0.285714
"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs Croft, in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; "and a very respectable family.	-- Elles sont tres simples et tres gracieuses vraiment, dit Mme Croft d'un ton moins enthousiaste, ce qui fit supposer a Anna qu'elle ne les trouvait pas tout a fait dignes de son frere.	0.383766
One could not be connected with better people.	<< C'est une famille tres respectable, d'excellentes gens.	0.21
My dear Admiral, that post! ~~~ we shall certainly take that post."	Mon cher amiral, faites donc attention, nous allons verser.	-0.0115385
But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.		-0.3
Chapter 11 The time now approached for Lady Russell's return: the day was even fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.	>> Elle prit les renes et evita l'obstacle, puis empecha la voiture de tomber dans une orniere, ou d'accrocher une charrette.	-0.0509434
It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families.	Anna s'amusa a penser que cette maniere de conduire ressemblait peut-etre a celle dont ils faisaient leurs affaires.	0.283895
This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.	Cette pensee la conduisit jusqu'au cottage. ~~~ CHAPITRE XI L'epoque du retour de lady Russel approchait, le jour etait meme fixe, et Anna, qui devait la rejoindre a Kellynch, commencait a craindre les inconvenients qui en pourraient resulter.	-0.0779126
She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.	Elle allait se trouver a un mille du capitaine ; elle irait a la meme eglise ; les deux familles se verraient. ~~~ D'un autre cote, il etait si souvent a Uppercross, qu'elle semblerait plutot l'eviter qu'aller au-devant de lui.	-0.0462766
They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little.	Elle ne pouvait donc qu'y gagner, ainsi qu'en changeant la societe de Marie contre celle de lady Russel.	0.0340909
These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough.	Elle aurait voulu ne pas rencontrer le capitaine dans cette maison qui avait vu leurs premieres entrevues.	0.197802
Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there, but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for.	Ce souvenir etait trop penible ; mais elle craignait encore plus une rencontre entre lady Russel et le capitaine.	0.121875
The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined.	Ils ne s'aimaient pas ; l'une etait trop calme, l'autre pas assez.	0.166071
Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.	La fin de son sejour a Uppercross fut marquee par un evenement inattendu.	0.331797
A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.	Wenvorth s'etait absente pour aller voir son ami Harville, installe a Lyme pour l'hiver avec sa famille.	0.208614
Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.	Il ne s'etait jamais completement retabli d'une blessure recue deux annees auparavant. ~~~ Quand Wenvorth revint, la description de ce beau pays excita tant d'enthousiasme qu'on resolut d'y aller tous ensemble.	-0.0177019
He had been there for four-and-twenty hours.	Les jeunes gens surtout desiraient ardemment voir Lyme.	0.223077
His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither was the consequence.	Les parents auraient voulu remettre le voyage au printemps suivant, mais quoiqu'on fut en novembre, le temps n'etait pas mauvais. ~~~ Louisa desirait y aller, mais surtout montrer que quand elle voulait une chose, elle se faisait.	-0.039433
The young people were all wild to see Lyme.	Elle decida ses parents, et le voyage fut resolu.	0.25
Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.		-0.3
The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going and returning.	On renonca a l'idee d'aller et revenir le meme jour pour ne pas fatiguer les chevaux de M. Musgrove, et l'on se reunit de bonne heure pour dejeuner a Great-House.	0.214203
They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.	Mais il etait deja midi quand on atteignit Lyme. ~~~ Apres avoir commande le diner, on alla voir la mer.	-0.00529412
This was felt to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone.	La saison etait trop avancee pour offrir les distractions des villes d'eau, mais la remarquable situation de la ville, dont la principale rue descend presque a pic vers la mer, l'avenue qui longe la charmante petite baie, si animee pendant la belle saison, la promenade du Cobb, et la belle ligne de rochers qui s'etend a l'est de la ville, toutes ces choses attirent l'oeil du voyageur, et quand on a vu Lyme une fois, on veut le revoir encore.	0.26592
After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea.	Il faut voir aussi Charmouth avec ses collines, ses longues lignes de terrains et sa baie tranquille et solitaire, cernee par de sombres rochers.	0.292683
They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.	On est la si bien a contempler reveusement la mer !	0.214286
The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.		-0.3
The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood.		-0.3
The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all, proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth's account: for in a small house, near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.	Il faut voir la partie haute de Lyme avec ses bois, et surtout Pumy avec ses verts abimes, creuses entre les rochers ou poussent pele-mele des arbres forestiers et des arbres fruitiers ; sites attestant le long travail du temps qui a prepare ces endroits merveilleux, egales seulement par les sites fameux de Wight !	0.220111
Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he was to join them on the Cobb.	Il faut avoir vu et revu ces endroits pour connaitre la beaute de Lyme.	0.147458
They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long, when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.	Nos amis se dirigerent vers la maison des Harville, situee sur le Cobb ; le capitaine y entra seul et en sortit bientot avec M. et Mme Harville et le capitaine Benwick.	0.110474
Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little history of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies. ~~~ He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now mourning her loss.		-0.3
They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion.	Benwick avait ete commandant sur la Laconia.	0.2
Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.	Les louanges que Wenvorth avait faites de lui l'avaient mis dans une haute estime a Uppercross, mais l'histoire de sa vie privee l'avait rendu encore plus interessant.	0.212727
She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.	Il avait epouse la soeur de Harville et venait de la perdre.	0.266667
Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change.	La fortune leur etait arrivee apres deux ans d'attente, et Fanny etait morte trop tot pour voir la promotion de son mari.	0.27895
He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.	Il aimait sa femme et la regrettait autant qu'homme peut le faire. ~~~ C'etait une de ces natures qui souffrent le plus, parce qu'elles sentent le plus.	-0.0535714
To finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.	Serieux, calme, reserve, il aimait la lecture et les occupations sedentaires. ~~~ La mort de sa femme resserra encore l'amitie entre les Harville et lui ; il vint demeurer avec eux.	-0.0357616
Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.	Harville avait loue a Lyme pour six mois ; sa sante, ses gouts, son peu de fortune l'y attiraient ; tandis que la beaute du pays, la solitude de l'hiver convenaient a l'etat d'esprit de Benwick.	0.451824
The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.	<< Cependant, se disait Anna, son ame ne peut etre plus triste que la mienne.	0.295312
"And yet," said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the party, "he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.	Je ne puis croire que toutes ses esperances soient fletries. ~~~ Il est plus jeune que moi, sinon de fait, du moins comme sentiment ; plus jeune aussi parce qu'il est homme.	-0.0370787
I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.	Il se consolera avec une autre, et sera encore heureux.	0.286667
He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.	>> Le capitaine Harville etait grand, brun, d'un aspect aimable et bienveillant, mais il boitait un peu : ses traits accentues et son manque de sante lui donnaient l'air plus age que Wenvorth.	-0.166667
He will rally again, and be happy with another."	Benwick etait et paraissait le plus jeune des trois, et semblait petit, compare aux deux autres.	0
They all met, and were introduced.	Il avait un air doux et melancolique et parlait peu.	0.16
Captain Harville was a tall, dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain Wentworth.	Harville, sans egaler Wenvorth comme manieres, etait un parfait gentleman, simple, cordial, obligeant.	0.089011
Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them, a little man.	Mme Harville, un peu moins distinguee que son mari, paraissait tres bonne. ~~~ Leur accueil aux amis de Wenvorth fut charmant.	-0.0247253
He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.	Le repas commande a l'auberge servit d'excuse pour refuser leur invitation a diner.	0.674405
Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners, was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.	Mais ils parurent presque blesses que Wenvorth n'eut pas amene ses amis sans qu'il fut besoin de les inviter.	0.241304
Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.	Tout cela montrait tant d'amitie pour le capitaine, et un sentiment d'hospitalite si rare et si seduisant ; si different des invitations banales, des diners de ceremonie et d'apparat, qu'Anna se dit avec une profonde tristesse : << Voila quels auraient ete mes amis ! ~~~ >> On entra dans la maison.	-0.0254032
The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them.	Les chambres etaient si petites qu'il semblait impossible d'y recevoir. ~~~ Anna admira les arrangements ingenieux du capitaine Harville pour tirer parti du peu d'espace, remedier aux inconvenients d'une maison meublee, et defendre les portes et les fenetres contre les tempetes de l'hiver.	-0.0175676
There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.	Le contraste entre les meubles vulgaires et indispensables fournis par le proprietaire, et les objets de bois precieux, admirablement travailles, que le capitaine avait rapportes de lointains voyages, donnait a Anna un autre sentiment que le plaisir.	0.282668
"These would have been all my friends," was her thought; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.	Ces objets rappelaient la profession de Wenvorth, ses travaux, ses habitudes, et ces images du bonheur domestique lui etaient penibles et agreables a la fois.	0.323098
On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many.	Le capitaine Harville ne lisait pas, mais il avait confectionne de tres jolies tablettes pour les livres de Benwick.	0.139394
Anne had a moment's astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected.	Son infirmite l'empechait de prendre beaucoup d'exercice, mais son esprit ingenieux lui fournissait constamment de l'occupation a l'interieur.	-0.0135338
The varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.	Il peignait, vernissait, menuisait et collait ; il faisait des jouets pour les enfants, et perfectionnait les navettes, et quand il n'avait plus rien a faire, il travaillait dans un coin a son filet de peche.	-0.0861137
Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.	Quand Anna sortit de la maison, il lui sembla qu'elle laissait le bonheur derriere elle. ~~~ Louisa, qui marchait a son cote, etait dans le ravissement.	-0.0507874
His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within.	Elle admirait le caractere des officiers de marine : leur amabilite, leur camaraderie, leur franchise et leur droiture.	0.23301
He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.	Elle soutenait que les marins valent mieux que tous les autres, comme coeur et comme esprit ; et que seuls ils meritent d'etre respectes et aimes.	0.118033
Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.	On alla diner, et l'on etait si content que tout fut trouve bon : les excuses de l'hotelier sur la saison avancee et le peu de ressources a Lyme etaient inutiles. ~~~ Anna s'accoutumait au capitaine Wenvorth plus qu'elle n'eut jamais cru ; elle n'avait aucun ennui d'etre assise a la meme table que lui, et d'echanger quelques mots polis.	-0.0650538
They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being "so entirely out of season," and the "no thoroughfare of Lyme," and the "no expectation of company," had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn.	Harville amena son ami ; et tandis que lui et Wenvorth racontaient pour amuser la compagnie nombre d'histoires dont ils etaient les heros, le hasard placa Benwick a cote d'Anna.	0.132886
Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.	Elle se mit a causer avec lui par une impulsion de bonte naturelle ; il etait timide et distrait, mais les manieres gracieuses d'Anna, son air engageant et doux produisirent leur effet, et elle fut bien payee de sa peine.	0.246941
The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow, but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.	Il avait certes un gout tres cultive en fait de poesie ; et Anna eut le double plaisir de lui etre agreable en lui fournissant un sujet de conversation que son entourage ne lui donnait pas, et de lui etre utile en l'engageant a surmonter sa tristesse : cela fut amene par la conversation, car, quoique timide, il laissa voir que ses sentiments ne demandaient qu'a s'epancher.	0.312224
He ventured among them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general. ~~~ While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.	Ils parlerent de la poesie, de la richesse de l'epoque actuelle, et, apres une courte comparaison entre les plus grands poetes, ils chercherent s'il fallait donner la preference a Marmion ou a la dame du Lac, a la fiancee d'Abydos ou au Giaour ; il montra qu'il connaissait bien les tendres chants de l'un, les descriptions passionnees et l'agonie desesperee de l'autre.	0.00529197
He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.	Sa voix tremblait en recitant les plaintes d'un coeur brise, ou d'une ame accablee par le malheur, et semblait solliciter la sympathie.	0.169565
He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their conversation.	Anna lui demanda s'il faisait de la poesie sa lecture habituelle ; elle esperait que non, car le sort des poetes est d'etre malheureux, et il n'est pas donne a ceux qui eprouvent des sentiments vifs d'en gouter les jouissances dans la vie reelle.	0.129902
For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.		-0.3
His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.	Benwick laissa voir qu'il etait touche de cette allusion a son etat d'esprit ; cela enhardit Anna, et, sentant que son esprit avait un droit de priorite sur Benwick, elle l'engagea a faire dans ses lectures une plus grande place a la prose ; et comme il lui demandait de preciser, elle nomma quelques-uns de nos meilleurs moralistes, des collections de lettres admirables, des memoires de nobles esprits malheureux ; tout ce qui lui parut propre a elever et fortifier l'ame par les plus hauts preceptes et les plus forts exemples de resignation morale et religieuse.	0.416084
Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to procure and read them.	Benwick ecoutait attentivement, et, tout en secouant la tete pour montrer son peu de foi en l'efficacite des livres pour un chagrin comme le sien, il prit note des livres qu'elle lui recommandait et promit de les lire.	0.26978
When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination.	La soiree finie, Anna s'amusa de l'idee qu'elle etait venue passer un jour a Lyme pour precher la patience et la resignation a un jeune homme qu'elle n'avait jamais vu.	0.438871
Chapter 12 Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.	En y reflechissant davantage, elle craignit d'avoir, comme les grands moralistes et les predicateurs, ete eloquente sur un point qui n'etait pas en rapport avec sa conduite.	0.236066
They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted.	CHAPITRE XII Le lendemain matin, Anna et Henriette descendirent sur la plage pour regarder la maree montante, qu'un leger vent du sud-est amenait en larges nappes sur le rivage uni.	0.257463
They praised the morning; gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with-- "Oh!	Apres avoir admire ensemble la mer, et aspire avec delices cette brise matinale, Henriette dit soudain : << Oui, je suis convaincue que l'air de la mer fait du bien.	0.286861
yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good.		-0.3
There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring twelve-month.	Il a rendu un bien grand service au docteur Shirley apres sa maladie, au printemps dernier.	0.371276
He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.	Il a dit lui-meme qu'un mois passe a Lyme lui a fait plus de bien que tous les remedes, et que la mer le rajeunit.	0.385714
Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.	C'est facheux qu'il n'y demeure pas toute l'annee.	0.156818
I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.	Il ferait mieux de quitter Uppercross et de se fixer a Lyme.	0.719538
Do not you, Anne?	Ne trouvez-vous pas, Anna ?	0.12
Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?	Convenez avec moi que c'est la meilleure chose qu'il puisse faire pour lui et pour Mme Shirley.	0.296203
She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand, in case of his having another seizure.	Elle a ici des cousines et beaucoup de connaissances qui lui rendront le pays agreable, et puis, elle sera bien aise d'avoir ici un medecin a sa portee, en cas d'une nouvelle attaque.	0.317183
Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out from all the world.	Je trouve bien triste que ces excellentes gens, qui ont fait du bien toute leur vie, passent leurs dernieres annees dans un endroit tel qu'Uppercross, ou, excepte notre famille, ils n'ont personne a voir. ~~~ Ses amis devraient l'engager a venir : il aurait facilement une dispense de residence.	0.0155844
I wish his friends would propose it to him.	Mais pourra-t-on lui persuader de quitter sa paroisse ?	0.2
I really think they ought.	Il est si scrupuleux !	0.236842
And, as to procuring a dispensation, there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character. ~~~ My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.	Ne trouvez-vous pas qu'il l'est trop, et qu'il y a une conscience exageree a sacrifier sa sante pour des devoirs qu'un autre remplirait aussi bien ?	0.0192547
He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I must say.	S'il venait a Lyme, il ne serait qu'a six lieues, et pourrait savoir ce qui se passe dans sa paroisse.	0.223881
Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?	>> Anna sourit plus d'une fois pendant ce discours.	0.293182
Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well performed by another person?	Elle etait aussi prete a sympathiser avec Henriette qu'avec Benwick.	0.137727
And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything to complain of."	Elle dit tout ce qu'on pouvait dire de raisonnable et d'a-propos.	0.0267857
Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?		-0.3
She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate's being married.	Elle comprenait les droits du docteur Shirley a la retraite et la necessite d'un remplacant ; elle poussa l'obligeance jusqu'a insinuer qu'il vaudrait mieux que ce dernier fut marie.	0.290968
"I wish," said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, "I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.	<< Je voudrais, dit Henriette tres contente, que lady Russel demeurat a Uppercross et fut dans l'intimite du docteur.	0.243
I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody!	On m'a toujours dit qu'elle a une grande influence sur ses amis.	0.650427
I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything!	Je la crains parce qu'elle est tres perspicace, mais je la respecte beaucoup et je la voudrais voir a Uppercross.	0.27655
I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross."	>> Anna s'amusa de voir que les interets d'Henriette mettraient lady Russel en faveur.	0.0202703
Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful, and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.		-0.3
They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.	Elle n'eut pas le temps de repondre, car Louisa et Wenvorth s'approchaient.	0.0230769
They were all at her disposal.	Ils proposerent de retourner ensemble a la ville.	0.103846
When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back, and stopped to give them way.	Arrives a l'escalier qui conduisait a la plage, ils virent devant eux un gentilhomme qui s'effaca pour leur livrer passage.	0.348571
They ascended and passed him; and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.	Anna surprit le regard d'admiration qu'il attacha sur elle, et n'y fut pas insensible.	0.0202703
She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced.	Elle etait tres jolie ce jour-la, la brise du matin avait rendu la fraicheur a son teint, et donne de l'eclat a ses yeux.	0.0030303
It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.	Il etait evident que l'inconnu l'admirait.	0.381203
Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it.	Wenvorth s'en apercut et jeta a Anna un regard rapide et brillant qui semblait dire : << Cet homme vous admire, et moi je reconnais maintenant Anna Elliot.	0.260471
He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, "That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again."	>> Apres avoir un peu flane par la ville, on revint a l'auberge.	0.00485175
After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.	Anna, en se rendant de sa chambre dans la salle a manger, rencontra l'inconnu, qui sortait de son appartement.	-0.0112903
She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.	Elle avait deja devine que c'etait l'etranger, et que c'etait son groom qu'elle avait apercu pres de la maison.	0.0925532
Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.	Maitre et domestique etaient en deuil.	0.176471
It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good manners.		-0.3
He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.	Il la regarda encore et s'excusa de sa brusque apparition avec une grace charmante.	0.261905
Anne felt that she should like to know who he was.		-0.3
They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to the window.	Il paraissait avoir trente ans : ses traits, sans etre beaux, etaient si agreables qu'Anna eut le desir de le connaitre.	0.228713
It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going away.	Le dejeuner etait a peine fini quand le bruit d'une voiture attira les convives a la fenetre.	0.502564
It was driven by a servant in mourning.	C'etait un curricle conduit par un groom en deuil.	0.209091
The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity, and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.		-0.3
"Ah!" ~~~ cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne, "it is the very man we passed."	Tous les regards curieux virent le maitre sortir a son tour, accompagne des saluts obsequieux de l'aubergiste.	0.0616466
The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.		-0.3
The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.	Il monta en voiture et saisit les renes. ~~~ << Ah !	-0.00375
"Pray," said Captain Wentworth, immediately, "can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away?"	c'est celui que nous avons rencontre deja, dit le capitaine Wenvorth en jetant un regard a Anna.	0.251852
"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night from Sidmouth.	<< Pouvez-vous, dit-il a l'aubergiste, nous dire le nom du gentleman qui vient de partir ?	0.640612
Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and London."		-0.3
"Elliot!" ~~~ Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity of a waiter.		-0.3
"Bless me!" ~~~ cried Mary; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot, it must, indeed!	-- C'est un gentleman tres riche, M. Elliot, arrive la nuit derniere de Sydmouth.	0.0882812
Charles, Anne, must not it?	Il va a Bath, et de la a Londres.	0.275
In mourning, you see, just as our Mr Elliot must be.	>> Elliot !	0.06
How very extraordinary!	on se regarda en repetant ce nom.	0.218182
In the very same inn with us!	<< Dieu !	-0.3
Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot? ~~~ my father's next heir?	s'ecria Marie, ce doit etre notre cousin, Anna, n'est-ce pas le plus proche heritier de mon pere ?	-0.096
Pray sir," turning to the waiter, "did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family?"	Dites-moi, monsieur, dit-elle en s'adressant a l'aubergiste, n'avez-vous pas entendu dire qu'il appartient a la famille de Kellynch ?	0.405446
"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day."	-- Non, madame, il n'a rien dit de particulier a cet egard, mais le groom a dit que son maitre sera un jour baronnet.	0.48
"There! ~~~ you see!"	-- Vous voyez !	-0.0576923
cried Mary in an ecstasy, "just as I said! ~~~ Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!	s'ecria Marie ravie ; heritier de Sir Walter !	0.395652
I was sure that would come out, if it was so.		-0.3
Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish, wherever he goes.	Soyez surs que ses domestiques prennent soin de le publier partout ou il va.	0.215625
But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!	Je regrette de ne l'avoir pas mieux regarde.	0.292105
I wish I had looked at him more.	Quel malheur !	0
I wish we had been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.		-0.3
What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!	Si j'avais ete avertie a temps, les presentations auraient pu se faire.	0.498042
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?	Trouvez-vous qu'il ressemble aux Elliot ?	0.728571
I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!	Je l'ai a peine regarde ; j'examinais les chevaux. ~~~ Il est surprenant que ses armoiries ne m'aient pas frappee.	-0.0363158
Oh! ~~~ the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning, one should have known him by the livery."	Son manteau les cachait, autrement je les aurais remarquees, et la livree aussi.	-0.25
"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together," said Captain Wentworth, "we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."	-- Si nous rassemblons toutes ces circonstances, dit Wenvorth, il faut supposer que la Providence a voulu que nous ne soyons pas presentes a votre cousin.	0.212308
When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable.	>> Anna fit tranquillement remarquer a Marie que, depuis nombre d'annees, leur pere et M. Elliot n'etaient pas dans des termes a rendre une presentation desirable.	0.427258
At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.	Cependant elle eprouvait une satisfaction secrete d'avoir vu son cousin, et de savoir que le futur proprietaire de Kellynch etait un vrai gentleman.	0.467323
She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage, and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.	Elle se garda bien de dire qu'elle l'avait rencontre dans le corridor : Marie se fut froissee que sa soeur eut recu une politesse dont elle n'avait pas eu sa part.	-0.16791
"Of course," said Mary, "you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the next time you write to Bath.	<< Vous parlerez sans doute de cette rencontre quand vous ecrirez a Bath, dit Marie.	0.261972
I think my father certainly ought to hear of it; do mention all about him."	Il faut que mon pere le sache : n'y manquez pas.	0.123077
Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what ought to be suppressed.		-0.3
The offence which had been given her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt.		-0.3
Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne.	>> Marie n'ecrivait jamais a Bath, la fatigue d'une froide et ennuyeuse correspondance reposait sur sa soeur.	0.415603
Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme.	Bientot M. et Mme Harville et Benwick vinrent chercher la compagnie pour faire une derniere promenade autour de Lyme.	0.477
They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together, and out of doors as long as they could.		-0.3
Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all fairly in the street.	On partit, et Benwick se rapprocha d'Anna.	0.358784
Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.	On parla encore de Walter Scott et de lord Byron, sans pouvoir etre du meme avis, quand le hasard amena Harville aupres d'Anna.	-0.0268868
"Miss Elliot," said he, speaking rather low, "you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much.	<< Miss Elliot, lui dit-il tout bas, vous avez fait une bonne action, en faisant causer ce pauvre garcon.	0.282955
I wish he could have such company oftener. ~~~ It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is; but what can we do?	Il faudrait qu'il eut plus souvent votre compagnie ; c'est mauvais pour lui d'etre confine ici.	-0.0166667
We cannot part." ~~~ "No," said Anne, "that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand."		-0.3
"Ay, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only June."	Mais, que voulez-vous, nous n'y pouvons rien.	0.2775
"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon."	Nous ne pouvons pas nous separer.	0.237931
"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape, just made into the Grappler.	-- Non, dit Anna, mais le temps est un grand consolateur, et votre ami est en deuil depuis bien peu de temps.	0.26625
I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.	C'est depuis l'ete dernier, je crois ?	-0.245455
There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?	-- Oui, en juin, dit-il avec un profond soupir.	0.2625
not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.	-- Et il ne l'a pas su tout de suite ?	0.134483
Nobody could do it, but that good fellow" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)	-- Seulement les premiers jours d'aout, en revenant du Cap.	0.223529
"The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being sent to sea again.	Je n'etais pas la pour le preparer : qui pouvait le faire, si ce n'est ce bon capitaine Wenvorth ?	0.292308
He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.	Il ecrivit pour demander un conge, voyagea jour et nuit et ne quitta pas le pauvre Benwick pendant une semaine ; personne que lui ne pouvait le consoler.	0.153543
That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.	Si vous saviez combien nous l'aimons !	0.109091
You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!"	>> On ramena les Harville chez eux, puis on voulut revoir une derniere fois le Cobb.	0.133333
Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.		-0.3
Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.		-0.3
By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found, would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.		-0.3
Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.	Anna se trouva encore pres de Benwick.	0.2
Lord Byron's "dark blue seas" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible.	Lord Byron et les Mers bleues ne pouvaient pas manquer d'etre cites en presence de la mer ; mais bientot leur attention fut attiree ailleurs.	0.472295
It was soon drawn, perforce another way. ~~~ There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.	On descendait les marches qui facilitent la pente raide du Cobb ; Louisa seule prefera sauter comme elle l'avait deja fait avec l'aide de Wenvorth.	-0.0729529
In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the sensation was delightful to her.	Il resista d'abord : elle insista et obtint ce qu'elle voulait.	0.161111
The hardness of the pavement for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it, however.	Pour montrer sa joie, elle remonta les marches et voulut sauter de nouveau.	0.164062
She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.	Cette fois, le capitaine resista davantage, car il trouvait le saut dangereux.	0.233824
He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, "I am determined I will:" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!	Elle sourit en disant : << Je suis decidee a sauter. ~~~ >> Il avanca les mains, mais elle s'elanca trop vite, et tomba sur le pave du Cobb !	-0.148661
There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face was like death.	On la releva evanouie ; ni sang ni blessure visible ; mais les yeux etaient fermes, le pouls ne battait plus, elle avait la paleur de la mort.	0.371672
The horror of the moment to all who stood around!	Ce moment fut horrible pour tous.	0.604433
Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms, looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence. ~~~ "She is dead!	Le capitaine s'agenouilla et la prit entre ses bras ; il etait aussi pale qu'elle, et la regardait, muet de douleur.	-0.0278351
she is dead!" ~~~ screamed Mary, catching hold of her husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them. ~~~ "Is there no one to help me?"	<< Elle est morte, s'ecria Marie, saisissant le bras de son mari, deja glace de terreur. ~~~ Henriette s'evanouit et serait tombee si Benwick et Anna ne l'avaient soutenue.	-0.277083
were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strength were gone.	Wenvorth, qui semblait accable, s'ecria d'un ton de desespoir : << Personne ne viendra-t-il m'aider ?	0.258621
"Go to him, go to him," cried Anne, "for heaven's sake go to him.	-- Allez-y ! ~~~ pour l'amour de Dieu, allez-y, s'ecria Anna.	-0.00588235
I can support her myself.	Je peux soutenir Henriette.	0.259091
Leave me, and go to him.	Frottez-lui les mains, les tempes ; tenez voici des sels.	-0.135
Rub her hands, rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them."	>> Benwick obeit, et Charles se degageant de sa femme, ils souleverent Louisa et la soutinrent entre eux deux.	0.127119
Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony-- "Oh God!	On fit ce qu'Anna avait dit, mais en vain tandis que Wenvorth chancelant s'appuyait contre le mur, et s'ecriait avec le plus profond desespoir : << Ah ! ~~~ ciel !	-0.187218
her father and mother!"	son pere et sa mere !	0.229412
"A surgeon!" ~~~ said Anne.	-- Un medecin, dit Anna.	-0.0142857
He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only-- "True, true, a surgeon this instant," was darting away, when Anne eagerly suggested-- "Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?	>> Ces mots semblerent l'electriser ; il s'elancait deja, quand Anna dit vivement : << Ne vaudrait-il pas mieux que ce fut le capitaine Benwick ?	0.14876
He knows where a surgeon is to be found."	il sait ou demeure le docteur.	0.207692
Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother's care, and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.	>> Cette observation parut si juste, que Benwick confia a Charles ce pauvre corps evanoui et disparut en un instant.	0.245918
As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he could not give.	Il serait difficile de dire lequel des trois etait le plus malheureux, de Wenvorth, d'Anna ou de Charles. ~~~ Ce dernier, penche sur Louisa, sanglotait, et quand il tournait les yeux, il voyait son autre soeur evanouie, et sa femme, presque en proie a une crise nerveuse, qui l'appelait a son aide.	-0.0704453
Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.	Anna, tout en s'occupant d'Henriette avec tout le zele que l'instinct lui suggerait, s'efforcait encore de consoler les autres. ~~~ Elle apaisait Marie, ranimait Charles, rendait un peu de calme au capitaine.	-0.0279661
Both seemed to look to her for directions.	Ces deux derniers semblaient se laisser diriger par elle.	0.183333
"Anne, Anne," cried Charles, "What is to be done next?	<< Anna, s'ecria Charles, que faut-il faire, au nom du ciel ?	0.540119
What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?"	-- Ne vaudrait-il pas mieux la porter a l'auberge ?	0.251351
Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.	-- Oui, c'est cela, s'ecria Wenvorth.	0.163636
"Had not she better be carried to the inn?	Je vais la porter ; Charles, prenez soin des autres.	0.222857
Yes, I am sure: carry her gently to the inn."	>> Le bruit de l'accident s'etait bientot repandu.	0.243243
"Yes, yes, to the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively collected, and eager to be doing something.	Les bateliers et les ouvriers du Cobb se rassemblaient pour contempler une jeune femme morte.	0.24375
"I will carry her myself.	Henriette fut confiee a l'un d'eux.	0.177273
Musgrove, take care of the others."	Anna marchait a cote de Louisa.	0.255556
By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first report.	Charles soutenait sa femme : ils reprirent le chemin qu'ils venaient de traverser si joyeux, un moment auparavant, maintenant si desoles ! ~~~ Les Harville vinrent a leur rencontre.	-0.077451
To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they had passed along.		-0.3
They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.	Benwick, en passant, les avait avertis.	0.18
Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately, informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.		-0.3
Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done.	Harville etait un homme de sang-froid et de ressources.	0.08125
She must be taken to their house; all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.	Apres quelques mots echanges avec sa femme, il decida que Louisa serait transportee chez lui.	0.28875
They would not listen to scruples: he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them.		-0.3
Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without apparent consciousness.	Il ne voulut ecouter aucune objection et fut obei.	0.0418605
This had been a proof of life, however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility. ~~~ Mary, too, was growing calmer.	Tandis que Mme Harville faisait porter Louisa dans son propre lit, son mari administrait a tous des soins, des cordiaux.	-0.0594538
The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.	Louisa ouvrit une fois les yeux, puis les referma.	0.223256
They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.	Ce fut une preuve de vie qui fut utile a sa soeur.	0.15
The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries recovered from: he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.	L'alternative de crainte et d'espoir empecha Henriette de retomber dans son evanouissement.	0.162963
That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may be conceived.		-0.3
The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!"	Marie aussi fut plus calme.	0.1375
was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.		-0.3
Louisa's limbs had escaped.	Le medecin arriva plus vite qu'on n'esperait.	0.12
There was no injury but to the head.	Pendant son examen, chacun eprouvait une angoisse cruelle.	0.08
It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done, as to their general situation.	Mais il y avait de l'espoir ; la tete avait recu un fort ebranlement, le medecin en avait vu de plus graves.	0.3
They were now able to speak to each other and consult.	Ils en ressentirent tous une joie profonde et l'on adressa au ciel les plus fervents remerciements.	0.0333333
That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble, did not admit a doubt.	Anna se dit qu'elle n'oublierait jamais le regard et l'accent de Wenvorth disant : << Dieu soit loue !	0.176471
Her removal was impossible. ~~~ The Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.	>> non plus que son attitude, les bras croises sur la table, et la tete dans ses mains, comme s'il etait ecrase par ses emotions, et cherchait a se calmer par la priere et le silence.	-0.087766
They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect.	Il fallait pourtant prendre un parti.	-0.0545455
Captain Benwick must give up his room to them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.	Louisa ne pouvait etre transportee ; mais les Harville avaient deja tout prevu : Benwick cederait sa chambre, et l'on improviserait des lits pour ceux qui voudraient coucher.	0.239655
They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet perhaps, by "putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging a cot somewhere," they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.		-0.3
Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such another.	Mme Harville offrait de se charger de Louisa : c'etait une garde-malade experte ; et sa bonne d'enfants etait une seconde elle-meme.	0.387578
Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by day or night.	Louisa serait veillee nuit et jour.	0
And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.	Tout cela fut dit d'un accent sincere et vrai, qui etait irresistible.	0.520769
Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.	Charles, Anna et Wenvorth se demandaient avec effroi comment on pourrait porter la triste nouvelle a Uppercross.	0.54055
"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time."		-0.3
At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth, exerting himself, said-- "We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.		-0.3
Every minute is valuable.	La matinee etait fort avancee.	0.247826
	On se desolait, quand Wenvorth s'ecria : << Il n'y a pas de temps a perdre, les minutes sont precieuses.	-0.3
Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly.	L'un de nous doit partir immediatement.	0.154286
Musgrove, either you or I must go."	Musgrove, est-ce vous ou moi ?	0.682418
Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.	>> Charles repondit qu'il ne pouvait supporter l'idee de quitter Louisa.	0.522727
He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville; but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.	Henriette voulait aussi rester, mais elle fut forcee de reconnaitre qu'elle ne serait utile a rien, elle qui s'etait trouvee mal envoyant l'accident de sa soeur.	0.376965
So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.	Elle reflechit a la douleur de ses parents, et consentit a partir.	0.288889
She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.		-0.3
The usefulness of her staying! ~~~ She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!	A ce moment, Anna, sortant de la chambre de Louisa, entendit Wenvorth qui disait : << C'est entendu, Musgrove, vous restez, et je ramene votre soeur a la maison.	-0.00112782
She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she was anxious to be at home.	Mais si quelqu'un reste ici pour aider Mme Harville, ce ne peut etre que miss Anna, si elle le veut bien : elle a toutes les qualites pour cela ; d'ailleurs votre femme veut sans doute retourner aupres de ses enfants.	0.285882
The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door was open.	>> Anna, entendant ces paroles, resta d'abord immobile d'emotion. ~~~ Elle entra dans la chambre.	-0.0740964
"Then it is settled, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth, "that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.	<< Vous resterez pour la soigner, j'en suis sur, lui dit-il avec un elan et une douceur qui semblaient rappeler le passe.	0.284375
But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be only one.	>> Elle rougit fortement, et lui, reprenant possession de lui-meme, s'eloigna.	0.243478
Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne."	Elle dit qu'elle etait prete, et heureuse de rester, qu'elle y avait pense, et souhaite qu'on lui permit de le faire.	0.266327
She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of.	Un lit a terre dans la chambre de Louisa lui suffirait, si Mme Harville le trouvait bon.	0.460634
	Wenvorth proposa de prendre une chaise de poste pour aller plus vite ; et d'envoyer demain, de bonne heure, l'equipage a Uppercross pour donner des nouvelles de Louisa.	-0.3
The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then appeared.	Quand Marie sut ce qu'on avait decide, elle se recria.	0.221739
"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;" cried he, turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which seemed almost restoring the past.	Elle se plaignit avec amertume de l'injustice qui lui faisait preferer Anna : elle, la soeur de Louisa.	0.12069
She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away.	Pourquoi ne serait-elle pas aussi utile qu'Anna !	0.216279
She expressed herself most willing, ready, happy to remain.	et la laisser retourner sans son mari !	0.127273
"It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.	Non, c'etait vraiment trop dur ! ~~~ Elle en dit tant que Charles dut ceder.	-0.0103448
A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so."	Jamais Anna ne s'etait soumise avec plus de repugnance aux fantaisies jalouses de Marie.	0.272368
One thing more, and all seemed arranged.	Elle partit pour la ville, avec Henriette, Charles et Benwick.	0.137143
Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night.	Pendant le trajet, elle revit les endroits qui lui rappelaient les plus petits details de la matinee : ici elle avait ecoute les projets d'Henriette ; plus loin, elle avait vu M. Elliot ; mais elle ne put donner qu'un moment a tout ce qui n'etait pas Louisa.	0.0598094
Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part, and to be soon followed by the two ladies.	Le capitaine Benwick fut tres attentif pour Anna ; l'accident arrive ce jour-la les avait tous unis davantage ; elle sentait pour lui un redoublement de bienveillance, et pensait meme avec plaisir que c'etait peut-etre une occasion pour elle et lui de se connaitre davantage.	-0.140426
When the plan was made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.	Wenvorth les attendait avec une chaise de poste au bas de la rue.	0.227778
She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta's stead! ~~~ Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?	Anna fut froissee de son air surpris quand il la vit venir au lieu de Marie, et de l'exclamation qui lui echappa quand Charles lui eut dit pourquoi.	-0.0786885
And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!	Elle crut qu'elle n'etait appreciee qu'en raison de son utilite.	0.257143
No, it was too unkind.	Elle s'efforca d'etre calme et juste.	0.0789474
And in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable.	Pour l'amour de Wenvorth, elle eut soigne Louisa avec un zele infatigable.	-0.135938
Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending to her.	Elle espera qu'il ne serait pas longtemps assez injuste pour croire qu'elle avait recule devant cette tache.	0.0354839
She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning.	Apres avoir aide Henriette a monter, Wenvorth s'assit entre elles deux ; ce fut ainsi qu'Anna etonnee et emue, quitta Lyme.	0.384441
There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.		-0.3
Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.		-0.3
Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.		-0.3
She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.	Ce long trajet modifierait-il leurs relations ?	0.285
Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.		-0.3
In the meanwhile she was in the carriage.	quelle serait la conversation ?	0.225
He had handed them both in, and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.		-0.3
How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.		-0.3
It was all quite natural, however.	Elle ne pouvait rien prevoir.	0.253846
He was devoted to Henrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.	Il s'occupa d'Henriette, se tournant toujours vers elle, cherchant a soutenir son espoir, a relever son courage.	0.207216
In general, his voice and manner were studiously calm.		-0.3
To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle.	Il tachait d'avoir l'air calme pour lui epargner toute agitation.	0.294737
Once only, when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as if wholly overcome-- "Don't talk of it, don't talk of it," he cried.	Une fois seulement, comme elle deplorait la malencontreuse promenade sur le Cobb, il ne put se contenir, et s'ecria : << Ne parlez pas de cela, de grace, Ah !	0.253697

that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment!	si j'avais refuse au moment fatal !	0.555
Had I done as I ought!	Si j'avais fait mon devoir !	0.2
But so eager and so resolute! ~~~ Dear, sweet Louisa!"	Mais elle etait si vive, si resolue, cette chere et douce Louisa.	-0.0333333
Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits.		-0.3
She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character. ~~~ They got on fast.	>> Anna se demandait s'il etait encore aussi sur des avantages et du bonheur attaches a la fermete de caractere, et s'il ne pensait pas que cette qualite, comme toute autre, a ses limites.	0.0757475
Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon.		-0.3
Their actual speed, heightened by some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day before.	Il ne pouvait guere manquer de reconnaitre qu'un caractere facile a plus de chance de bonheur qu'un caractere tres resolu.	0.294118
It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.		-0.3
In a low, cautious voice, he said:-- "I have been considering what we had best do.	On allait vite ; la route semblait a Anna moitie moins longue que la veille.	0.46369
She must not appear at first. ~~~ She could not stand it.	Cependant la nuit etait venue quand on arriva a Uppercross.	-0.0163043
I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.	Henriette, immobile dans un coin de la voiture, la tete enveloppee dans son chale, semblait s'etre endormie en pleurant.	0.291262
Do you think this is a good plan?"		-0.3
She did: he was satisfied, and said no more. ~~~ But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.	Wenvorth se pencha vers Anna et lui dit a voix basse : << J'ai songe a ce qu'il y a de mieux a faire.	0.0596203
When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were baited, he was off.	Henriette ne pourra supporter le premier moment ; ne feriez-vous pas mieux de rester dans la voiture avec elle, tandis que je vais annoncer la nouvelle aux parents ?	0.0586957
(End of volume one.) ~~~ Chapter 13 The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have been difficulties.		-0.3
They had an early account from Lyme the next morning. ~~~ Louisa was much the same.	>> Cet appel a son jugement lui fit plaisir, c'etait une preuve d'amitie et de deference.	-0.0154412
No symptoms worse than before had appeared. ~~~ Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account. ~~~ He was tolerably cheerful.	Quand Wenvorth eut dit aux parents la triste nouvelle, quand il les vit un peu plus calmes, et Henriette contente d'etre avec eux, il retourna a Lyme aussitot que les chevaux furent reposes.	-0.145872
A speedy cure must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.	CHAPITRE XIII Anna passa a Great-House les deux dernieres journees de son sejour a Uppercross.	0.285185
In speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.	Sa societe et ses conseils furent d'un grand secours aux Musgrove, dans la situation d'esprit ou ils se trouvaient.	0.235714
"She really left nothing for Mary to do. ~~~ He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night.	Ils eurent des nouvelles de Lyme le lendemain, et Charles arriva quelques heures apres pour donner plus de details.	-0.0133333
Mary had been hysterical again this morning. ~~~ When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.	Louisa n'etait pas plus mal ; on ne pouvait pas esperer une guerison rapide, mais l'accident n'aurait pas de suites facheuses.	-0.0238318
He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do."	Il ne pouvait tarir sur les louanges de Harville et de sa femme.	0.157682
Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.	Celle-ci avait decide Charles et Marie a aller coucher a l'hotel.	0.494643
It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.	Marie avait eu une crise nerveuse le matin, puis elle avait ete se promener avec Benwick. ~~~ Son mari esperait que cela lui ferait du bien.	-0.00391304
A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.		-0.3
Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.		-0.3
They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours.	Charles revint encore le lendemain donner de meilleures nouvelles : la malade avait de plus longs intervalles de lucidite.	0.381429
He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his account was still encouraging.	Le capitaine Wenvorth paraissait installe a Lyme.	0.163636
The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger.	Le jour suivant, quand Anna se prepara a partir, ce fut un chagrin general.	0.290164
Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.	Il semblait qu'on ne put rien faire sans elle.	0.146154
Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.	Alors elle leur suggera l'idee d'aller tous s'installer a Lyme jusqu'a ce que Louisa put etre transportee.	0.12931
"What should they do without her?	On viendrait ainsi en aide a Mme Harville, en prenant ses enfants.	0.0206897
They were wretched comforters for one another."	Ce projet fut accepte avec empressement.	0.25
And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.	Anna les aida a faire leurs preparatifs, et, les ayant vus partir, elle resta seule pour mettre tout en ordre.	0.0913043
She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.	Quel contraste dans ces deux maisons si animees quelques jours auparavant !	-0.152308
They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children; and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence.		-0.3
She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.		-0.3
A few days had made a change indeed!	Excepte les enfants de sa soeur, elle etait seule a Uppercross.	0.393333
If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.	Mais si Louisa guerissait, le bonheur reparaitrait ici plus grand qu'avant.	0.417073
More than former happiness would be restored. ~~~ There could not be a doubt, to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.	Quelques mois encore, et ces chambres, maintenant si desertes, seraient remplies de la joie et de la gaite de l'amour heureux, si inconnu a Anna Elliot !	-0.0169565
A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!	Une heure entiere de reflexions semblables par un sombre jour de novembre, avec une petite pluie serree qui empechait de rien distinguer au dehors, c'en etait assez pour que la voiture de lady Russel fut accueillie avec joie.	0.292063
An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.	Et cependant, en quittant Mansion-House, en jetant un regard d'adieu au cottage, avec sa triste veranda ruisselant de pluie ; en regardant a travers les vitres les humbles maisons du village, Anna ne put se defendre d'un sentiment de tristesse.	0.11139
Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.	Uppercross lui etait cher.	0.6
It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.	Il lui rappelait bien des peines, maintenant adoucies ; quelques essais d'amitie et de reconciliation, auxquels elle ne devait plus songer ; de tout cela il ne lui restait rien que le souvenir !	0.294974
She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had been.		-0.3
Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house in September.	Elle n'etait pas rentree a Kellynch depuis le mois de septembre.	0.446364
It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from. ~~~ Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its mistress.	Ce fut cette fois dans l'elegante et moderne habitation de son amie qu'elle descendit, y apportant une joie melee d'inquietude, car lady Russel connaissait les visites de Wenvorth a Uppercross.	-0.0536364
There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.	Elle trouva Anna rajeunie, et lui fit compliment de sa bonne mine.	0.289286
She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross. ~~~ But happily, either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty.	Anna se rejouit de ces louanges, car, en les ajoutant a la silencieuse admiration d'Elliot, elle put esperer qu'un second printemps de jeunesse et de beaute lui etait donne.	0.0349315
When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.	Elle s'apercut d'un changement dans son propre esprit en causant avec lady Russel.	0.25082
The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.	Quand elle etait arrivee a Kellynch, elle n'avait pas trouve d'abord la sympathie qu'elle esperait.	0.222384
She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.	Mais peu a peu ses preoccupations changerent d'objet.	0.255319
Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick, than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy with Mrs Clay.	Elle oublia son pere, sa soeur et Bath et quand, revenue a Kellynch, lady Russel lui en parla, exprimant sa satisfaction de les savoir bien installes a Camben-Place, elle eut ete confuse qu'on sut qu'elle ne pensait qu'a Lyme et a Louisa, et a toutes ses connaissances la-bas.	0.0937533
She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.	L'amitie des Harville et du capitaine Benwick la touchait bien plus que la maison de son pere, ou l'intimite de sa soeur avec Mme Clay.	0.219643
There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject.	Mais elle etait forcee de paraitre s'interesser autant que lady Russel a ce qui la touchait pourtant de plus pres que toute autre.	0.326226
They must speak of the accident at Lyme.	Il y eut d'abord un peu de gene dans leur conversation.	0.194118
Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both. ~~~ Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.	Wenvorth ne pouvait manquer d'etre nomme, en parlant de l'accident arrive a Lyme : Anna n'osait regarder lady Russel en prononcant le nom de Wenvorth.	-0.0627801
She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.	Elle s'avisa d'un expedient : elle raconta brievement l'attachement de Wenvorth et de Louisa l'un pour l'autre.	0.257292
When this was told, his name distressed her no longer.	Une fois cela fait, elle n'eprouva plus d'embarras.	0.293333
Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt, that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.	Lady Russel se contenta d'ecouter tranquillement, et de leur souhaiter tout le bonheur possible, mais elle eprouva un plaisir amer en voyant l'homme qui, huit ans auparavant, avait paru apprecier Anna Elliot, se contenter de Louisa Musgrove.	0.545887
The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather improving account of Louisa.	Les premiers jours n'eurent d'autre diversion que quelques bonnes nouvelles de Lyme sur la sante de Louisa. ~~~ Anna ne sut jamais comment elles lui parvinrent.	-0.0677778
At the end of that period, Lady Russell's politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone, "I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.	Lady Russel ne voulut pas remettre davantage ses visites de politesse. ~~~ Elle dit a Anna d'un ton decide : << Je dois aller voir M. et Mme Croft.	0.0152661
Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?	Aurez-vous le courage de m'accompagner dans cette maison ?	0.576471
It will be some trial to us both."	C'est une epreuve pour nous deux.	0.289286
Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said, in observing-- "I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.	-- C'est vous qui en souffrirez le plus probablement ; vous n'avez pas encore pris votre parti de ce changement.	0.0606383
By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it."	En restant dans le voisinage, je m'y suis accoutumee.	0.26087
She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners'.		-0.3
These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again, and returning through the well-known apartments.		-0.3
In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, "These rooms ought to belong only to us.	>> Elle aurait pu ajouter qu'elle avait une haute opinion des Croft, et trouvait son pere heureux d'avoir de tels locataires.	0.197468
Oh, how fallen in their destination! ~~~ How unworthily occupied!	Elle sentait que la paroisse avait un bon exemple, et les pauvres, aide et secours.	-0.0375
An ancient family to be so driven away! ~~~ Strangers filling their place!"	Elle ne pouvait s'empecher de reconnaitre que Kellynch etait en de meilleures mains qu'auparavant.	-0.0547619
No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description to heave.	Cette conviction etait certainement penible et mortifiante, mais elle lui epargnait la souffrance que devait eprouver lady Russel en retournant dans cette maison.	0.250413
Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving her in that house, there was particular attention.	Elle ne songeait point a se dire : << Ces chambres devraient etre habitees par nous.	0.0864706
The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting it any more.	Oh !	-0.6
He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.	combien elles sont dechues de leur destination ! ~~~ Une ancienne famille obligee de ceder la place a des etrangers !	-0.0757732
This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done.	>> Non, excepte en pensant a sa mere, qui avait demeure la, elle n'avait aucun soupir de regret.	0.28
As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!		-0.3
The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming-- "Ay, a very bad business indeed.	Mme Croft semblait l'avoir prise en grande amitie, et, dans cette visite, elle eut des attentions particulieres.	0.184286
A new sort of way this, for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head, is not it, Miss Elliot?	On causa surtout du triste accident arrive a Lyme... Wenvorth avait apporte des nouvelles ; il s'etait particulierement informe de miss Elliot, et exprimait l'espoir que tout ce qu'elle avait fait ne l'avait pas trop fatiguee.	0.12
This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!"	Cela fit un vif plaisir a Anna.	0.455769
Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell, but they delighted Anne.	Quant au triste accident, deux dames si sensees ne pouvaient avoir qu'une meme opinion.	0.272
His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible.	C'etait pour elles la consequence de beaucoup d'etourderie et d'imprudence.	0.265
	Les suites en seraient tres graves, et il etait terrible de penser a la longue convalescence encore douteuse de miss Musgrove, exposee a se ressentir longtemps de cet ebranlement.	-0.3
"Now, this must be very bad for you," said he, suddenly rousing from a little reverie, "to be coming and finding us here.	L'amiral resuma tout, en disant : << Voila une triste affaire ; c'est la, pour un jeune homme, une nouvelle maniere de faire sa cour.	0.27
I had not recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.	Briser la tete de sa fiancee, puis mettre un emplatre dessus.	0.276923
But now, do not stand upon ceremony.	N'est-ce pas, miss Elliot ?	0.2125
Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it."	>> Les manieres de l'amiral n'etaient pas completement du gout de lady Russel, mais elles ravissaient Anna.	0.0367347
"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now." ~~~ "Well, whenever it suits you.	Cette bonte de coeur et cette simplicite de caractere etaient pour elle irresistibles.	-0.0285714
You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door.	<< C'est vraiment tres ennuyeux pour vous de nous voir ici, dit-il tout a coup, sortant d'une reverie.	0.265116
A good place is not it?	Je n'y avais pas encore pense.	0.189474
But," (checking himself), "you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the butler's room.	Ne faites pas de ceremonies, montez et visitez toute la maison, si bon vous semble.	0.201429
Ay, so it always is, I believe.	-- Une autre fois, monsieur ; je vous remercie ; pas a present.	0
One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.	-- Eh bien, quand vous voudrez.	-0.0555556
And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not."	Vous verrez vos ombrelles accrochees a cette porte. ~~~ N'est-ce pas un bon endroit ?	-0.0232394
Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.	Non, sans doute, car vous mettiez les votres dans la chambre du sommelier.	0.236538
"We have made very few changes either," continued the Admiral, after thinking a moment.	Chacun a ses habitudes et ses idees.	0.249194
"Very few. ~~~ We told you about the laundry-door, at Uppercross.	Nous avons fait tres peu de changements, continua-t-il apres une pause.	-0.0190909
That has been a very great improvement.	<< Celui de la porte de la buanderie a ete une grande amelioration.	0.480882
The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did, so long!	On se demande comment vous avez pu supporter si longtemps la facon dont elle s'ouvrait ?	0.231081
You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had.	Vous direz a Sir Walter ce que nous avons fait ; M. Shepherd pense que la maison n'a jamais eu de meilleur changement.	0.685119
Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better.	<< Nous pouvons nous rendre cette justice : tout ce que nous avons fait a ete pour le mieux.	0.338
My wife should have the credit of them, however.	C'est ma femme qui en a le merite.	0.160714
I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's. ~~~ A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot," (looking with serious reflection), "I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.	J'ai fait moi-meme peu de chose, si ce n'est d'enlever les grandes glaces de mon cabinet de toilette, qui etait celui de votre pere : un homme excellent, et un veritable gentleman ; mais il me semble, miss Elliot, qu'il est bien tire a quatre epingles pour son age.	0.0219853
Such a number of looking-glasses!	Que de glaces, mon Dieu !	0.171429
oh Lord! ~~~ there was no getting away from one's self.	il n'y a pas moyen de s'echapper a soi-meme.	-0.00416667
So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I never go near."	Je suis tres commodement maintenant avec mon petit miroir dans un coin, et une autre grande chose dont je n'approche jamais.	0.174286
Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer, and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up the subject again, to say-- "The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.	>> Anna, amusee en depit d'elle-meme, ne savait que repondre, et l'amiral, craignant d'avoir ete impoli, ajouta : << La premiere fois que vous ecrirez a votre bon pere, miss Elliot, faites-lui mes compliments ; dites-lui que tout ici est a notre gout, et que nous n'y trouvons aucun defaut.	0.337069
The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three times a winter.	Il faut avouer que la cheminee de la salle a manger fume un peu, mais seulement quand le vent est grand et vient du nord, ce qui n'arrive pas trois fois par hiver, et sachez bien que nous n'avons pas encore trouve de maison aussi agreable que celle-ci, dites-le-lui, il sera content.	0.154914
And take it altogether, now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we like better than this.	>> Les Croft, en rendant a lady Russel sa visite, annoncerent qu'ils allaient voir des parents dans le Nord.	0.214286
Pray say so, with my compliments. ~~~ He will be glad to hear it."	Ainsi disparut tout danger de rencontrer le capitaine Wenvorth a Kellynch.	-0.0339623
Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.		-0.3
So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.	Anna sourit en pensant combien elle s'etait tourmentee a ce sujet.	0.0789474
Everything was safe enough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject.	CHAPITRE XIV Charles et Marie furent les premiers a retourner a Uppercross.	0.193846
Chapter 14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge.		-0.3
They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.		-0.3
They had been all in lodgings together.	Ils ne tarderent pas a revenir a Lodge.	0.290909
Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.	On sut par eux que Louisa commencait a se lever, mais elle etait encore tres faible, tres impressionnable, et il etait impossible de dire quand elle pourrait voyager.	0.0434483
Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.	Marie avait eu des ennuis, mais son long sejour prouvait qu'elle avait eu plus de plaisir que de peine.	0.244186
Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.	Charles Hayter etait venu plus souvent, il est vrai, qu'elle n'aurait voulu ; puis, chez les Harville, il n'y avait qu'un domestique pour servir a table, et au commencement on n'avait pas donne a Marie la premiere place. ~~~ Mais on lui avait fait de si gracieuses excuses, quand on avait su de qui elle etait fille, et l'on avait ete si prevenant ensuite ; on lui avait prete des livres, et l'on avait fait si souvent de jolies promenades, que la balance etait en faveur de Lyme.	0.0959542
She had been taken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.	Tout cela, joint a la conviction d'etre tres utile, lui avait fait passer une agreable quinzaine.	-0.033168
Anne enquired after Captain Benwick.	Anna s'informa de Benwick.	0.7875
Mary's face was clouded directly.	La figure de Marie se rembrunit aussitot.	0.24
Charles laughed. ~~~ "Oh!	Charles se mit a rire : << Oh !	0.425
Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd young man.	Benwick va tres bien, dit Marie ; mais c'est un drole de garcon.	0.480323
I do not know what he would be at.	Il ne sait ce qu'il veut.	0.214286
We asked him to come home with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold!	Nous lui avons demande de venir passer quelques jours chez nous ; Charles devait l'emmener a la chasse.	0.388203
on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward sort of excuse; 'he never shot' and he had 'been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.	Il paraissait tres content, quand, mardi soir, il donna une singuliere excuse : Il ne chassait jamais ; on ne l'avait pas compris : il avait promis ceci, puis cela, etc. ; enfin il ne venait pas.	0.339572
I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."	Il a sans doute craint de s'ennuyer, mais en verite j'aurais cru que nous etions assez gais au cottage pour le coeur brise du capitaine Benwick.	0.366111
Charles laughed again and said, "Now Mary, you know very well how it really was.	>> Charles dit en riant : << Mais, Marie, vous savez bien ce qu'il en est.	0.4525
It was all your doing," (turning to Anne.)	<< Voici votre oeuvre, dit-il a Anna.	0.2625
"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not courage to come.	Il s'imaginait vous trouver ici ; quand il a su que vous etiez a une lieue de nous, il n'a pas eu le courage de venir.	0.104728
That is the fact, upon my honour.	Voila la verite ; parole d'honneur.	0.267857
Mary knows it is." ~~~ But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.	>> Marie laissa tomber la conversation, soit qu'elle ne jugeat pas Benwick digne de pretendre a une miss Elliot, soit qu'elle ne reconnut pas a Anna le pouvoir de rendre Uppercross plus attrayant. ~~~ Je laisse ce point a decider au lecteur.	0.000916667
Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard.	Le bon vouloir d'Anna cependant n'en fut point diminue.	0.2375
She boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries.	Elle dit qu'on la flattait trop, et continua a questionner.	0.223529
"Oh!	<< Oh !	0.24
he talks of you," cried Charles, "in such terms--" Mary interrupted him. ~~~ "I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there.	il parle de vous dans des termes... >> Marie l'interrompit : << Je vous assure, Charles, que je ne l'ai pas entendu nommer Anna deux fois.	0.0645511
I declare, Anne, he never talks of you at all."	-- Je n'en sais rien, mais il vous admire beaucoup.	0.269231
"No," admitted Charles, "I do not know that he ever does, in a general way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.		-0.3
His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--oh!		-0.3
I cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then 'Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms!		-0.3
Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were in the other room.	Sa tete est remplie des lectures que vous lui avez recommandees, et il desire en causer avec vous.	0.221538
'Elegance, sweetness, beauty.'	Il a decouvert... oh !	0.142105
Oh! ~~~ there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms."	je ne puis me rappeler quoi, quelque chose de tres beau.	-0.0219512
"And I am sure," cried Mary, warmly, "it was a very little to his credit, if he did.	Il expliquait cela a Henriette, et, parlant de vous, il prononcait les mots : elegance, douceur, beaute.	0.37402
Miss Harville only died last June. ~~~ Such a heart is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?	Oh ! ~~~ je l'ai entendu, Marie ; vous etiez dans l'autre chambre : il ne pouvait tarir sur les perfections de miss Elliot.	-0.171687
I am sure you will agree with me." ~~~ "I must see Captain Benwick before I decide," said Lady Russell, smiling.	-- Il faut convenir, dit Marie avec vivacite, que, s'il a dit cela, ce n'est pas a sa louange : sa femme est morte en juin dernier.	-0.0228261
"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am," said Charles.	Un coeur pareil n'est pas desirable ; n'est-ce pas, lady Russel ?	0.223636
"Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.	-- Et je vous affirme que vous le verrez bientot, dit Charles, il n'a pas eu le courage de venir au cottage, mais il trouvera quelque jour la route de Kellynch, comptez-y.	0.270213
I told him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.	Je lui ai dit que l'eglise meritait d'etre vue, et comme il a du gout pour ces sortes de choses il aura la un bon pretexte. ~~~ Il a ecoute avidement, et je suis sur qu'il viendra bientot.	-0.0437822
So, I give you notice, Lady Russell."	Ainsi je vous avertis, lady Russel.	0.290323
"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me," was Lady Russell's kind answer.	-- Les amis d'Anna seront toujours les bienvenus chez moi, repondit-elle obligeamment.	0.296053
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
as to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he is rather my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight."	dit Marie, quant a etre une connaissance d'Anna, il est plutot la mienne, car je l'ai vu tous les jours de cette quinzaine.	0.25
"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick."	-- Eh bien, je serai tres heureuse de voir le capitaine Benwick comme votre connaissance a toutes deux.	0.247297
"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.	-- Vous ne trouverez rien de tres agreable en lui, je vous assure : c'est l'homme le plus ennuyeux qu'on puisse voir.	0.329286
He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived. ~~~ He has walked with me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.	Il s'est promene sur la plage avec moi, plusieurs fois, sans dire un mot : Il n'est pas bien eleve, et il est certain que vous ne l'aimerez pas.	-0.00641026
He is not at all a well-bred young man.		-0.3
I am sure you will not like him."		-0.3
"There we differ, Mary," said Anne.		-0.3
"I think Lady Russell would like him.	-- En cela, nous differons, dit Anna.	0.3
I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner."	Je crois que lady Russel l'aimera, et que son esprit lui plaira tellement qu'elle ne trouvera aucun defaut a ses manieres.	0.256667
"So do I, Anne," said Charles.	-- Je pense comme vous, dit Charles.	0.670879
"I am sure Lady Russell would like him.	Il a justement ce qu'il faut pour lady Russel.	0.245455
He is just Lady Russell's sort.		-0.3
Give him a book, and he will read all day long."	Donnez-lui un livre, et il lira toute la journee.	0.276923
"Yes, that he will!" ~~~ exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.	-- Oui, s'ecria railleusement Marie.	-0.0403846
"He will sit poring over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one drops one's scissors, or anything that happens.	Il meditera sur son livre, et ne saura pas si on lui parle, ou si on laisse tomber ses ciseaux.	0.163636
Do you think Lady Russell would like that?"		-0.3
Lady Russell could not help laughing.	Croyez-vous que lady Russel aime cela ?	0.290909
"Upon my word," said she, "I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may call myself.	>> Lady Russel ne put s'empecher de rire : << En verite, dit-elle, je n'aurais pas suppose que l'opinion d'une personne calme et positive comme moi put etre appreciee si differemment.	0.292
I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.	Je suis vraiment curieuse de voir celui qui peut donner lieu a des idees si opposees.	0.421541
I wish he may be induced to call here.	Il faut le decider a venir ici.	0.242308
And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand."	Soyez sure, alors, Marie, que je dirai mon opinion ; mais je suis decidee a ne pas le juger d'avance.	0.260241
"You will not like him, I will answer for it."	-- Vous ne l'aimerez pas, je vous en reponds.	0.3
Lady Russell began talking of something else.	>> Lady Russel causa d'autre chose.	0.641475
Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.	Marie parla avec animation de la rencontre de M. Elliot.	0.347727
"He is a man," said Lady Russell, "whom I have no wish to see.	<< C'est un homme, dit lady Russel, que je ne desire pas voir.	0.294
His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me."	Son refus d'etre en bons termes avec le chef de la famille m'a laisse une impression defavorable.	0.386179
This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance.	>> Cette reflexion abattit l'enthousiasme de Marie et l'arreta court dans sa description.	0.265385
With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries, there was voluntary communication sufficient.		-0.3
His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected.		-0.3
As Louisa improved, he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week.	Anna n'osa faire de questions sur Wenvorth, mais elle sut qu'il etait moins inquiet a mesure que Louisa se remettait.	0.576339
He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.		-0.3
He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.	Il n'avait pas vu Louisa et craignait tellement l'emotion d'une entrevue avec elle, qu'il avait resolu de s'absenter une dizaine de jours.	0.15
There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.	A partir de ce moment, lady Russel et Anna penserent souvent a Benwick.	0.11
Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.	Lady Russel ne pouvait entendre sonner sans croire aussitot que c'etait lui, et Anna, chaque fois qu'elle sortait, se demandait en rentrant si elle allait le trouver a la maison.	0.244774
Captain Benwick came not, however.	Cependant on ne vit pas Benwick.	0.267857
He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.	Etait-il moins desireux de venir que Charles ne le croyait, ou etait-ce timidite de sa part ? ~~~ Apres l'avoir attendu une semaine, lady Russel le declara indigne de l'interet qu'il avait commence a lui inspirer.	0.0755766
The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.	Les Musgrove revinrent pour les vacances de leurs enfants et ramenerent avec eux ceux de Mme Harville, Henriette resta avec Louisa.	0.179464
Henrietta remained with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.	Lady Russel et Anna allerent faire visite a Mansion-House : la maison avait deja repris quelque gaite.	0.285542
Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.	Mme Musgrove, entouree des petits Harville, les protegeait contre la tyrannie des enfants du cottage.	0.214773
Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.	D'un cote on voyait une table occupee par les jeunes filles babillardes, decoupant des papiers d'or et de soie ; d'un autre, des plateaux charges de patisseries auxquelles les joyeux garcons faisaient fete.	0.265605
Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.	Un brillant feu de Noel faisait entendre son petillement en depit du bruit.	-0.140625
On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise of the others.		-0.3
Charles and Mary also came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children on his knees, generally in vain.	Charles et Marie etaient la aussi ; M. Musgrove s'entretenait avec lady Russel et ne parvenait pas a se faire entendre, assourdi par les cris des enfants qu'il avait sur les genoux.	0.421734
It was a fine family-piece.	C'etait un beau tableau de famille.	0.2125
Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.	Anna, jugeant les choses d'apres son temperament, trouvait que cet ouragan domestique n'etait guere fait pour calmer les nerfs de Louisa, si elle eut ete la ; mais Mme Musgrove n'en jugeait pas ainsi.	0.354695
But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.	Apres avoir chaudement remercie Anna de tous ses services, et recapitule tout ce qu'elle-meme avait souffert, elle dit, en jetant un regard heureux autour d'elle, que rien ne pouvait lui faire plus de bien que cette petite gaite tranquille.	0.164039
Louisa was now recovering apace.	Anna apprit que Louisa se retablissait a vue d'oeil.	0.634483
Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters went to school again.		-0.3
The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.		-0.3
Captain Wentworth was gone, for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.	Les Harville avaient promis de la ramener a Uppercross et d'y rester quelque temps.	0.28209
"I hope I shall remember, in future," said Lady Russell, as soon as they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays."	<< Je me souviendrai a l'avenir qu'il ne faut pas venir ici pendant les vacances de Noel, >> dit lady Russel une fois montee en voiture.	0.246429
Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather than their quantity. ~~~ When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of pattens, she made no complaint.	Peu de temps apres, elle arriva a Bath par un pluvieux apres-midi, longeant la longue suite de rues depuis Old-Bridge jusqu'a Camben-Place, eclaboussee par les equipages, assourdie par le bruit des charrettes et des camions, par les cris de marchands de journaux et de gateaux, ceux des laitieres et des pietons, elle ne se plaignit pas : non, c'etaient la des bruits appartenant aux plaisirs de l'hiver.	0.0248959
No, these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.	Elle se sentait renaitre, et, comme Mme Musgrove, elle pensait, mais sans le dire, qu'apres avoir ete longtemps a la campagne, rien n'etait si bon pour elle qu'une petite distraction tranquille.	0.3875
Anne did not share these feelings.	Anna n'etait pas de cet avis : elle persistait dans son antipathie pour Bath.	-0.05
She persisted in a very determined, though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived?	Elle apercut la longue suite de maisons enfumees, sans eprouver le desir de les voir de plus pres : le trajet, quoique desagreable, lui sembla trop rapide, car personne ne la desirait, et elle donna un souvenir de regret a la gaite bruyante d'Uppercross et a la solitude de Kellynch-Lodge.	0.320234
And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.		-0.3
Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest. ~~~ Mr Elliot was in Bath.	La derniere lettre d'Elisabeth lui annoncait que M. Elliot etait a Bath.	0.160526
He had called in Camden Place; had called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.	Il etait venu plusieurs fois a Camben-Place et s'etait montre extremement attentif.	0.502002
If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.	Si Elisabeth et son pere ne se trompaient pas, il les recherchait avec autant de soin qu'il en avait mis a les eviter. ~~~ Cela etait fort etonnant.	-0.0557851
This was very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being "a man whom she had no wish to see."	Lady Russel etait tres curieuse et tres perplexe, et retractait deja ce qu'elle avait dit a Anna : << Un homme qu'elle n'avait aucun desir de voir.	0.307728
She had a great wish to see him. ~~~ If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.	>> Maintenant elle desirait vivement le voir ; s'il cherchait reellement a se reconcilier, il fallait lui pardonner de s'etre ecarte de la famille.	0.0522436
Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.	Anna n'y mettait pas autant d'animation, mais elle preferait le revoir, et elle n'aurait pu en dire autant de bien d'autres a Bath.	0.299545
She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.	Elle descendit a Camben-Place, et lady Russel a son appartement, rue River.	0.216923
Chapter 15 Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.	CHAPITRE XV Sir Walter avait loue dans le quartier aristocratique une maison de grande apparence dont lui et Elisabeth etaient tres satisfaits.	0.438918
Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh!	Anna avait le coeur triste en entrant ; elle voyait devant elle un emprisonnement de plusieurs mois, et se disait avec anxiete : << Ah !	0.273786
when shall I leave you again?"	quand partirai-je ?	0.166667
A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome she received, did her good.	>> Elle fut recue cependant avec une cordialite inattendue qui lui fit du bien.	0.268657
Her father and sister were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her with kindness.		-0.3
Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage. ~~~ Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course.	Son pere et sa soeur furent contents de l'avoir pour lui montrer la maison et l'ameublement ; puis elle faisait un vis-a-vis a table, ce qui etait plus gai.	0.0447674
Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for.		-0.3
They were evidently in excellent spirits, and she was soon to listen to the causes.	Mme Clay fut tres aimable et souriante, c'etait son habitude.	0.203774
They had no inclination to listen to her. ~~~ After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all their own.		-0.3
Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it was all Bath.	Tout le monde etait de bonne humeur, et bientot Anna en sut la cause.	0.278947
They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect.	Apres quelques questions insignifiantes, la conversation n'eut plus d'autre sujet que Bath : on se souciait peu de Kellynch, et pas du tout d'Uppercross.	0.320076
Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste of the furniture. ~~~ Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.	Bath avait completement repondu a leur attente : leur maison etait la plus belle de Camben-Place, leurs salons superieurs a tous ceux qu'ils avaient vus, aussi bien par l'arrangement que par le gout du mobilier.	-0.0303371
Everybody was wanting to visit them. ~~~ They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.	Ils etaient recherches partout ; ils avaient refuse nombre de presentations, et encore a present beaucoup de personnes inconnues deposaient leurs cartes.	-0.00789474
Here were funds of enjoyment.	Quelles sources de plaisir !	0.288
Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy? ~~~ She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.		-0.3
But this was not all which they had to make them happy. ~~~ They had Mr Elliot too.	Anna pouvait-elle s'etonner que son pere et Elisabeth fussent heureux ?	-0.00967742
Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.		-0.3
He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him. ~~~ He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct, such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was completely re-established.		-0.3
They had not a fault to find in him. ~~~ He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side. ~~~ It had originated in misapprehension entirely.	Non ; mais elle s'attristait a la pensee que son pere eut abdique les devoirs et la dignite d'un lord residant sur ses terres, et qu'il n'en eut aucun regret ; que les petitesses d'une petite ville pussent satisfaire sa vanite.	-0.188
He had never had an idea of throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent. ~~~ Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he was quite indignant.	Elle soupirait, mais elle sourit quand Elisabeth, les portes ouvertes a deux battants, passa radieuse d'un salon dans un autre ; elle s'etonna que celle qui avait ete maitresse de Kellynch put trouver de quoi satisfaire son orgueil dans un espace de trente pieds de long.	-0.00619266
He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.	Mais ce n'etait pas cela seul qui causait leur bonheur : c'etait la presence de M. Elliot ; non seulement on lui pardonnait ; mais on en raffolait.	0.295041
He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct must refute it.	Il avait passe quinze jours a Bath et, des son arrivee, avait depose sa carte a Camben-Place.	0.26087
He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.	Il y fut ensuite tres assidu, et montra une telle franchise, une telle hate a s'excuser du passe, et un si grand desir d'etre recu a l'avenir comme un parent, que la bonne entente d'autrefois fut completement retablie.	0.402747
The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much extenuation.	Il se justifia a tous egards ; son impolitesse apparente venait d'un malentendu.	0.3
This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.		-0.3
Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.	Il avait cru qu'on voulait rompre avec lui, et s'etait retire par delicatesse.	0.116418
She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.	Il etait indigne qu'on eut pu l'accuser d'avoir parle de la famille sans respect ; lui, qui s'etait toujours vante d'etre un Elliot, et qui avait, sur la parente, des idees trop strictes pour l'epoque actuelle !	0.0823529
There had been the charm. ~~~ She had sought him.	Son caractere et sa conduite dementaient cette accusation.	-0.045
Without that attraction, not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.	Sir Walter pouvait en appeler a tous ceux qui connaissaient M. Elliot, et, certainement, les efforts qu'il avait faits pour se reconcilier avec la famille etaient une preuve en sa faveur.	0.673014
Here was a great deal to soften the business. ~~~ A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!	Ce fut le colonel Wallis, son ami intime, qui fournit une excuse pour le mariage de M. Elliot.	-0.0153846
Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.	Il, avait connu la femme de son ami ; elle n'etait pas de famille noble, mais elle etait instruite, bien elevee et riche et adorait William Elliot.	0.243443
Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.		-0.3
Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.	Voila ce qui l'avait seduit, et non sa fortune.	0.2625
Allowances, large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.	Tout cela attenuait beaucoup sa faute, et Sir Walter l'excusa completement : il l'avait recu, invite a diner, et M. Elliot paraissait tres heureux.	0.0863014
She heard it all under embellishment.	Anna ecoutait, mais sans comprendre.	0.3
All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators.		-0.3
Still, however, she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well received by them. ~~~ In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.	Tout en faisant la part de l'exageration, elle sentait qu'il y avait quelque chose d'inexplicable dans la conduite actuelle de M. Elliot, dans son desir si vif de renouer des relations si longtemps interrompues.	-0.0243506
In all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.	Materiellement parlant, il n'y gagnait rien, puisque le domaine et le titre de Kellynch lui revenaient en tout cas.	0.428571
A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object to him?	Elle ne trouvait qu'une solution : c'etait peut-etre a cause d'Elisabeth.	0.49375
She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.		-0.3
There might really have been a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his addresses to her.		-0.3
Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young himself.	Sa soeur etait certainement tres belle, ses manieres etaient distinguees et elegantes ; et Elliot, qui ne l'avait vue qu'en public, ne connaissait peut-etre pas son caractere.	0.486286
How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one.	Anna se demandait avec inquietude comment Elisabeth pourrait soutenir un examen plus attentif, et souhaitait qu'Elliot ne fut pas trop perspicace.	0.2825
Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.		-0.3
Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without being much attended to. ~~~ "Oh! ~~~ yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot. ~~~ They did not know. ~~~ It might be him, perhaps."	Mme Clay encourageait Elisabeth dans la pensee qu'Elliot la recherchait ; elles echangeaient des regards qu'Anna surprit au passage.	-0.204146
They could not listen to her description of him. ~~~ They were describing him themselves; Sir Walter especially.	Sir Walter rendait justice a William Elliot, a son elegance, a sa figure agreable, mais il deplorait son attitude penchee, defaut que le temps avait augmente.	0.104088
He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his sensible eye; but, at the same time, "must lament his being very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse.		-0.3
Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted;" but Sir Walter had "not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him. ~~~ He did not mean to complain, however.	Il convenait aussi qu'il avait vieilli ; tandis que M. Elliot affirmait que Sir Walter n'avait pas change depuis dix ans.	0.106016
Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere."		-0.3
Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the whole evening.		-0.3
"Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them!		-0.3
and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!" ~~~ and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as "a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.	On ne parla, le soir, que de M. Elliot et de M. Wallis ; Sir Walter desirait connaitre Mme Wallis ; on la disait tres jolie ; cela le dedommagerait des laids visages qu'il rencontrait a chaque instant dans les rues.	0.0245536
Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman, beautiful.		-0.3
"He longed to see her.	C'etait la le fleau de Bath.	0.221053
He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets.	Un jour il avait compte quatre-vingt-sept femmes, sans en trouver une passable.	0.208696
The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.	Il est vrai que c'etait par un froid brouillard du matin.	0.265116
He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.		-0.3
He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being a tolerable face among them.		-0.3
It had been a frosty morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of.		-0.3
But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!		-0.3
they were infinitely worse. ~~~ Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!	Les hommes etaient autant d'epouvantails dont les rues etaient pleines.	-0.00238095
It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.	A la maniere dont les femmes regardaient le colonel Wallis, quand il marchait au bras de Sir Walter, on pouvait juger combien rarement elles voyaient un bel homme.	0.242609
He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis." ~~~ Modest Sir Walter!		-0.3
He was not allowed to escape, however. ~~~ His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.	Voila ce que disait le modeste Sir Walter ; mais sa fille et Mme Clay ne lui permettaient pas de s'effacer ainsi et affirmaient qu'il avait au moins aussi bon air que le colonel, dont les cheveux etaient gris.	0.0130182
"How is Mary looking?"	<< Quelle figure a Marie ?	0.27
said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.	dit Sir Walter, a l'apogee de sa bonne humeur.	0.876923
"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day."	La derniere fois que je l'ai vue, elle avait le nez rouge, mais j'espere que cela ne lui arrive pas tous les jours.	0.191304
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
no, that must have been quite accidental.		-0.3
In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas."		-0.3
"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse."	non ; c'etait tout a fait accidentel ; depuis la Saint-Michel, elle a bonne mine et se porte bien.	0.394444
Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown, or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door suspended everything.	-- Si je ne craignais pas de lui donner la tentation de sortir par ce vent et de se gater le teint, je lui enverrais un chapeau neuf et une pelisse.	0.24958
"A knock at the door!	>> On frappa a la porte.	0.266667
and so late! ~~~ It was ten o'clock.	Qui pouvait-ce etre a dix heures ?	0
Could it be Mr Elliot?		-0.3
They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent.		-0.3
It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did.		-0.3
They could think of no one else.		-0.3
Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock."	Mme Clay reconnut la maniere de frapper de M. Elliot.	0.61938
Mrs Clay was right. ~~~ With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered into the room. ~~~ It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.	Il fut introduit avec ceremonie ; Anna se retira un peu a l'ecart, tandis qu'il s'excusait de venir a cette heure, mais il avait voulu savoir si Elisabeth et son amie n'avaient pas pris froid la nuit derniere.	-0.127206
Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but "he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before," &c. &c; which was all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part must follow then.		-0.3
Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; "Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter" (there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was. ~~~ He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his eyes brightened!	Quand les politesses furent echangees, Sir Walter presenta sa plus jeune fille, et Anna, souriante et rougissante, montra a M. Elliot le joli visage qu'il n'avait point oublie.	-0.0278276
and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already.	Il fut aussi charme que surpris ; ses yeux brillerent de plaisir ; il fit allusion au passe, et sollicita les droits d'une ancienne connaissance.	0.297521
He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only one person's manners. ~~~ They were not the same, but they were, perhaps, equally good. ~~~ He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.		-0.3
There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.	Sa physionomie parut a Anna aussi agreable qu'a Lyme.	0.57907
Ten minutes were enough to certify that.		-0.3
His tone, his expressions, his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.	Ses manieres etaient si aisees, si charmantes, qu'elle ne pouvait le comparer qu'a une seule personne.	0.218182
As soon as he could, he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her. ~~~ She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.		-0.3
His regret increased as he listened.	Il s'assit et anima la conversation.	0.3
He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.		-0.3
If he had but asked who the party were!	Il savait choisir ses sujets, s'arreter quand il fallait.	0.13125
The name of Musgrove would have told him enough.	Son ton, ses expressions annoncaient beaucoup de tact.	0.24878
"Well, it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious."	Il demanda a Anna ce qu'elle pensait de Lyme, et s'etendit surtout sur l'heureux hasard qui les avait reunis dans la meme auberge.	0.276376
"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," said he, "as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.	Quand elle lui raconta leur voyage a Lyme, il regretta doublement sa soiree solitaire dans la chambre voisine.	0.224916
The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view."	Il avait entendu des voix joyeuses, et aurait souhaite de se joindre a eux, mais il ne soupconnait guere qu'il pouvait y pretendre.	0.207143
But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.	Cela le guerirait, dit-il, de cette absurde habitude de ne questionner jamais.	-0.0352941
His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.	Bientot, sentant qu'il ne devait pas s'adresser uniquement a Anna, il rendit la conversation plus generale.	0.245161
Having alluded to "an accident," he must hear the whole. ~~~ When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.	Il voulut entendre le recit de l'accident, et Anna put comparer l'interet avec lequel il ecoutait, a l'air indifferent de Sir Walter et d'Elisabeth.	0.104211
She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it.	L'elegante petite pendule aux sons argentins avait frappe onze heures avant que M. Elliot ni personne se fut apercu qu'il etait reste une heure.	0.351148
He staid an hour with them.	Anna n'aurait jamais cru passer si bien sa premiere soiree a Bath.	-0.130435
The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck "eleven with its silver sounds," and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long.		-0.3
Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well!	CHAPITRE XVI Il y avait une chose qu'Anna desirait connaitre par-dessus tout : c'etaient les sentiments de son pere pour Mme Clay.	0.229213
Chapter 16 There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at home a few hours.		-0.3
On going down to breakfast the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.	Apres quelques heures passees a la maison, elle etait loin d'etre tranquille.	0.324799
She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that "now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, "That must not be any reason, indeed. ~~~ I assure you I feel it none.	Le lendemain matin, en descendant dejeuner, elle eut lieu de comprendre que cette dame avait trouve un pretexte pour s'en aller, car Elisabeth repondit tout bas : << Ce n'est pas une raison, je vous assure ; elle ne m'est rien, comparee a vous.	0.0298228
She is nothing to me, compared with you;" and she was in full time to hear her father say, "My dear madam, this must not be.	>> Puis elle entendit son pere, qui disait : << Chere madame, cela ne doit pas etre.	0.165217
As yet, you have seen nothing of Bath. ~~~ You have been here only to be useful.	Vous n'avez rien vu a Bath, et n'avez fait que vous rendre utile.	-0.0277778
You must not run away from us now.	Il ne faut pas nous fuir maintenant.	0.267857
You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.	Il faut rester, pour faire connaissance avec la belle madame Wallis.	0.534746
To your fine mind, I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification."	Je sais que la vue de la beaute est une reelle satisfaction pour votre esprit delicat.	0.257143
He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.	>> Il avait quelque chose de si vif dans les yeux et dans la voix, qu'Anna ne fut pas surprise du regard que Mme Clay jeta a Elisabeth.	0.528571
Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister.	Elle ne pouvait resister a de si vives instances : elle resta.	0.15
The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.	Sir Walter, se trouvant seul avec Anna, lui fit compliment de sa bonne mine.	0.295238
In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.		-0.3
Had she been using any thing in particular?" ~~~ "No, nothing."	Il lui trouvait les joues plus pleines, le teint plus clair et plus frais.	-0.0254717
"Merely Gowland," he supposed.	Employait-elle quelque chose de particulier ?	0.160714
"No, nothing at all."	Peut-etre du gowland.	0.284211
"Ha!	Non !	0.3
he was surprised at that;" and added, "certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.	rien du tout ? ~~~ Cela le surprenait, et il ajouta : << Vous n'avez qu'a continuer ainsi : vous ne pouvez pas etre mieux qu'a present.	-0.0977064
Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.	Autrement, je vous conseillerais le constant usage du gowland pendant le printemps.	0.287143
You see how it has carried away her freckles."	Sur ma recommandation, Mme Clay l'a employe, et vous en voyez le resultat : ses marques de petite verole ont disparu.	-0.153846
If Elizabeth could but have heard this!	>> Si Elisabeth avait pu l'entendre !	0.28125
Such personal praise might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened.	Ces louanges l'auraient d'autant plus etonnee que les marques en question n'avaient pas du tout disparu.	0.256667
But everything must take its chance.	Mais il faut subir sa destinee, se dit Anna.	0.253125
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also to marry.	Si Elisabeth se mariait, le mariage de son pere serait un mal moins grand.	0.270968
As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady Russell.	Quant a elle, elle pouvait demeurer avec lady Russel.	0.534783
Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.	La politesse et le savoir-vivre de celle-ci furent mis a l'epreuve quand elle vit Mme Clay en si grande faveur et Anna si negligee.	0.279412
The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.	Elle etait aussi vexee que peut l'etre une personne qui passe son temps a prendre les eaux, a lire les nouvelles et a faire des visites.	0.330655
As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more indifferent, towards the others.	Quand elle connut davantage M. Elliot, elle devint plus charitable pour lui ou plus indifferente pour les autres.	0.257647
His manners were an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliot?"	Il se recommandait par ses manieres. ~~~ Elle lui trouvait un esprit si serieux et si agreable qu'elle fut prete a s'ecrier : << Est-ce la M. Elliot ?	-0.0762295
and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.	>> et qu'elle ne pouvait imaginer un homme plus parfait : intelligence, jugement, connaissance du monde, et avec cela un coeur affectueux.	0.0636364
Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.	Il avait des sentiments d'honneur et de famille, ni orgueil, ni faiblesse ; il vivait sans faste, mais avec la liberalite d'un homme riche.	0.214286
He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.	Il s'en rapportait a son propre jugement dans les choses importantes, mais ne heurtait pas l'opinion publique lorsqu'il s'agissait de decorum.	0.321508
He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.	Il etait ferme, observateur, modere et sincere, ne se laissant emporter ni par son humeur, ni par son egoisme, deguises sous le nom de sentiments eleves, et cependant il etait touche par tout ce qui etait aimable et bon.	0.145902
She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.	Il appreciait tous les bonheurs de la vie domestique, qualite que possedent rarement les caracteres enthousiastes et remuants.	-0.167442
Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice.	Lady Russel etait persuadee qu'il n'avait pas ete heureux en mariage ; le colonel Wallis le disait ; mais cela ne l'avait point aigri ; et lady Russel commencait a le soupconner de songer a un nouveau choix.	0.510521
Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.	Sa satisfaction a cet egard, et nous verrons pourquoi, l'emportait sur l'ennui que lui donnait Mme Clay.	0.601194
It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.	Anna savait deja par experience que son excellente amie et elle pouvaient differer d'avis ; elle ne fut donc pas surprise que lady Russel ne vit dans la conduite de M. Elliot qu'un grand desir de reconciliation.	0.295963
In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of youth.		-0.3
Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to mention "Elizabeth."	Anna se permit cependant de sourire en nommant Elisabeth.	0.168
Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only this cautious reply:--"Elizabeth!	Lady Russel ecouta, regarda et fit cette prudente reponse : << Elisabeth ?	0.502381
very well; time will explain."	tres bien, nous verrons !	0.231818
It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation, felt she must submit to.		-0.3
She could determine nothing at present.	>> Anna dut s'en contenter.	0.1625
In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit of such general observance as "Miss Elliot," that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible.		-0.3
Mr Elliot, too, it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.		-0.3
A little delay on his side might be very excusable. ~~~ In fact, Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved.		-0.3
However it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath: she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.	Quoi qu'il en soit, M. Elliot etait a coup sur leur plus agreable connaissance a Bath ; elle ne trouvait personne aussi bien que lui, et trouvait un grand plaisir a parler de Lyme, qu'il desirait revoir autant qu'elle-meme.	0.465323
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times. ~~~ He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness.	Ils se rappelerent nombre de fois leur premiere rencontre ; il lui dit quel plaisir sa vue lui avait fait : elle avait devine, et se rappelait aussi le regard qu'un autre lui avait jete.	-0.0292969
She knew it well; and she remembered another person's look also.	Leurs opinions n'etaient pas toujours semblables.	0.233333
They did not always think alike. ~~~ His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers.	Elle s'apercut qu'il partageait sur la noblesse les idees de Sir Walter et d'Elisabeth.	-0.026
It was not merely complaisance, it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them.		-0.3
The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No.	Le journal annonca un matin l'arrivee de la douairiere, vicomtesse Dalrymph, et de sa fille, l'honorable miss Carteret.	0.200971
--, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne's opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.	A partir de ce moment, la tranquillite fut bannie de Camben-Place, car les Dalrymph etaient cousins des Elliot, et la difficulte etait d'etre presentes selon les regles. ~~~ Ce fut un grand sujet de perplexite.	0.0348214
Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.	Anna n'avait pas encore vu son pere ni sa soeur en relation avec la noblesse, et son desappointement fut grand.	0.264516
She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that they had more pride; for "our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret;" "our cousins, the Dalrymples," sounded in her ears all day long.	Elle avait espere qu'ils avaient une plus haute idee d'eux-memes et se trouva reduite a leur souhaiter plus d'orgueil, car nos cousins, les Dalrymph, resonnaient tout le jour a ses oreilles.	0.432182
Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount, when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch. ~~~ No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.		-0.3
The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.	A la mort du dernier vicomte, Sir Walter, etant malade, avait neglige de repondre a la lettre de faire part qui lui fut envoyee.	-0.0339623
How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question: and it was a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot thought unimportant.	On lui rendit la pareille a la mort de lady Elliot : il fallait reparer cette malheureuse negligence, et etre recus comme cousins : ce fut une grave question pour lady Russel et pour M. Elliot.	0.590362
"Family connexions were always worth preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.	Lady Dalrymph avait pris une maison pour trois mois a Laura-Place, et allait vivre grandement.	0.40463
She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman.	Elle avait ete a Bath l'annee precedente, et lady Russel l'avait entendu vanter comme une femme charmante.	0.596296
It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."	Il fallait renouer, si l'on pouvait le faire sans compromettre la dignite des Elliot.	0.10274
Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his right honourable cousin.	Sir Walter se decida a ecrire a sa noble cousine une longue lettre d'explications et de regrets.	0.42963
Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess. ~~~ "She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance."	Personne ne put admirer cette epitre, mais elle obtint le resultat desire : c'etaient trois lignes de griffonnage de la douairiere vicomtesse : << Elle etait tres honoree, et serait tres heureuse de faire leur connaissance.	-0.0031746
The toils of the business were over, the sweets began.	>> Le plus difficile etait fait ; il ne restait plus qu'a en gouter les douceurs.	0.163043
They visited in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible: and "Our cousins in Laura Place,"--"Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret," were talked of to everybody. ~~~ Anne was ashamed.	On fit visite a Laura-Place ; on recut les cartes de la douairiere, vicomtesse de Dalrymph, et de l'honorable miss Carteret.	-0.188571
Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created, but they were nothing.	Ces cartes furent mises en evidence, et l'on allait partout repetant << nos cousines de Laura-Place >>.	0.170455
There was no superiority of manner, accomplishment, or understanding.	Anna etait confuse de l'agitation causee par ces dames, d'autant plus qu'elles etaient tres ordinaires.	0.164516
Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of "a charming woman," because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody.	Lady Dalrymph avait acquis le titre de femme << charmante >> parce qu'elle avait un sourire et une reponse pour chacun.	0.430241
Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth.	Quant a miss Carteret, elle etait si vulgaire et si gauche, que sans sa noblesse on ne l'aurait pas supportee a Camben-Place.	0.393292
Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet "it was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had their value.	Lady Russel confessa qu'elle s'attendait a mieux, mais que c'etait une belle relation ; et quand Anna s'aventura a donner son opinion, M. Elliot convint que ces dames n'etaient rien par elles-memes, mais qu'elles avaient une valeur comme relations de famille et de bonne compagnie.	0.351023
Anne smiled and said, "My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company."	Anna sourit. ~~~ << J'appelle bonne compagnie, dit-elle a M. Elliot, les personnes instruites, intelligentes et qui savent causer.	0.0991979
"You are mistaken," said he gently, "that is not good company; that is the best.	-- Vous vous trompez, repondit-il doucement.	0.0975
Good company requires only birth, education, and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.	Ce n'est pas la la bonne compagnie : c'est la meilleure.	0.0319149
Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.	La bonne compagnie demande seulement de la naissance, de bonnes manieres et de l'education, et meme, elle n'est pas exigeante sur ce dernier point : tres peu d'instruction ne fait pas mal du tout.	0.196721
My cousin Anne shakes her head. ~~~ She is not satisfied. ~~~ She is fastidious.	Ma cousine Anna secoue la tete : elle n'est pas satisfaite : elle est difficile.	-0.142553
My dear cousin" (sitting down by her), "you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?	<< Ma chere cousine, dit-il en s'asseyant pres d'elle, vous avez plus de droits qu'une autre d'etre difficile. ~~~ Mais cela vous servira-t-il a quelque chose ?	-0.0287234
Will it make you happy?	En serez-vous plus heureuse ?	0.21
Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible?	N'est-il pas plus sage d'accepter la societe de ces bonnes dames, et d'en avoir les avantages ?	0.15375
You may depend upon it, that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for."	Soyez sure qu'elles brilleront aux premieres places cet hiver, et cette parente donnera a votre famille (permettez-moi de dire a notre famille) le degre de consideration que nous pouvons desirer.	0.312343
"Yes," sighed Anne, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"	-- Oui, soupira Anna, notre parente sera suffisamment connue.	0.266667
then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added, "I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance.	Je crois qu'on a pris trop de peine pour cela.	-0.497368
I suppose" (smiling) "I have more pride than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."	Il faut croire, dit-elle en souriant, que j'ai plus d'orgueil que vous tous, mais j'avoue que je suis vexee de cet empressement a faire connaitre notre parente, qui doit leur etre parfaitement indifferente.	0.36595
"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.	-- Pardonnez-moi, ma chere cousine ; vous etes injuste dans votre propre cause.	0.192
In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say: but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance."	Peut-etre qu'a Londres, avec notre simple train de vie, il en serait ainsi ; mais a Bath, Sir Walter Elliot et sa famille seront toujours apprecies a leur valeur.	0.54
"Well," said Anne, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place."	-- Eh bien ! ~~~ dit Anna, je suis trop orgueilleuse pour me rejouir d'un accueil du a l'endroit ou je suis.	0.0517544
"I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural. ~~~ But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.	-- J'aime votre indignation, dit-il ; elle est tres naturelle ; mais vous etes a Bath, et il s'agit d'y paraitre avec la dignite et la consideration qui appartiennent de droit a Sir Walter Elliot.	0.146121
You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little different.	Vous parlez d'orgueil : on me dit orgueilleux, je le suis, et ne desire pas paraitre autre ; car notre orgueil a tous deux, si l'on cherchait bien, est de meme nature, quoiqu'il semble different.	0.427778
In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin," (he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) "in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.	Sur un point, ma chere cousine (continua-t-il en parlant plus bas, quoiqu'il n'y eut personne dans la chambre), je suis sur que nous sommes du meme avis.	0.402455
We must feel that every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him."	Vous devez sentir que toute nouvelle connaissance que fera votre pere parmi ses egaux ou ses superieurs peut servir a le detacher de ceux qui sont au-dessous de lui.	0.293333
He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying: a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride, she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her.	>> Il regardait en parlant ainsi le siege que Mme Clay avait occupe. ~~~ C'etait un commentaire suffisant ; Anna fut contente de voir qu'il n'aimait pas Mme Clay, et elle le trouva plus qu'excusable, en faveur du but qu'il poursuivait, de chercher de hautes relations a son pere.	-0.0278139
Chapter 17 While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description.	CHAPITRE XVII Tandis que Sir Walter et Elisabeth se lancaient dans le grand monde, Anna renouait une connaissance d'un genre tres different. ~~~ Elle avait appris qu'une de ses anciennes compagnes demeurait a Bath.	0.100435
She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.	Mme Shmith (autrefois miss Hamilton), agee de trois ans de plus qu'Anna, avait ete tres bonne pour elle, quand elle entra a quatorze ans dans une pension, apres la mort de sa mere.	0.275839
Miss Hamilton, now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable.	Elle fit ce qu'elle put pour adoucir le chagrin d'Anna, qui en garda un souvenir reconnaissant.	0.233333
Anne had gone unhappy to school, grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time; and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.		-0.3
Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess's account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.	Miss Hamilton quitta la pension un an apres et epousa bientot un homme riche.	-0.0107692
She was a widow and poor.	Depuis deux ans, elle etait veuve et pauvre.	0.0571429
Her husband had been extravagant; and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully involved.	Son mari etait un extravagant qui dissipa sa fortune, et laissa des affaires embrouillees.	0.215385
She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for the present a cripple.	Elle eut des ennuis de toute espece. ~~~ Une fievre rhumatismale qui attaqua enfin les jambes la rendit infirme.	-0.140426
She had come to Bath on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.	Elle etait venue a Bath pour se guerir et demeurait pres des bains chauds, vivant tres modestement, sans domestique, et par consequent exclue de la societe.	0.431313
Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in going. ~~~ She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she intended, at home.	Anna, sachant par une amie commune que sa visite serait agreable, ne perdit pas de temps : elle ne dit rien chez elle, et consulta seulement lady Russel, qui l'approuva et la conduisit dans sa voiture pres du logement de Mme Shmith.	-0.00567568
It would excite no proper interest there.	Les deux anciennes amies renouvelerent connaissance.	0.2
She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.	Au premier moment, il y eut un peu de gene et d'emotion : douze ans s'etaient ecoules, et elles se trouvaient mutuellement changees.	0.167568
The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other more than re-kindled. ~~~ The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion.	Anna n'etait plus la silencieuse, timide et rougissante jeune fille de quinze ans, mais une elegante jeune femme, ayant toutes les beautes, excepte la fraicheur, aux manieres aussi agreables que parfaites ; et douze ans avaient transforme la belle et fiere miss Hamilton en une pauvre veuve infirme, recevant comme une faveur la visite de son ancienne protegee.	-0.16993
Twelve years were gone since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined.	Mais le premier malaise de leur rencontre fit bientot place au charme des vieux souvenirs.	0.183117
Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times.		-0.3
Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation.	Anna trouva dans Mme Shmith le bon sens et les manieres agreables auxquels elle s'attendait, et une disposition a la causerie et a la gaite au dela de son attente.	0.469104
Neither the dissipations of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits.	Ni les plaisirs du monde ou elle avait beaucoup vecu, ni la condition presente, pas plus que la maladie ou le chagrin, n'avaient ferme son coeur, ni eteint sa gaite.	0.232117
In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and Anne's astonishment increased.	A la seconde visite, elle causa tres librement, et l'etonnement d'Anna redoubla.	0.24
She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.	Elle ne pouvait guere imaginer une situation plus triste que celle de son amie.	0.500853
She had been very fond of her husband: she had buried him. ~~~ She had been used to affluence: it was gone. ~~~ She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.	Elle avait perdu un mari qu'elle adorait, une fortune a laquelle elle etait accoutumee ; elle n'avait pas d'enfants pour la rattacher a la vie et au bonheur ; aucun parent pour l'aider dans des affaires embarrassees ; pas meme de sante pour supporter tout le reste.	-0.122222
Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.	Elle s'accommodait d'un parloir bruyant, et d'une chambre obscure par derriere ; elle ne pouvait bouger sans l'aide de l'unique servante de l'hotel, et elle ne sortait que pour etre portee aux bains chauds.	0.203448
Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.	En depit de tout cela, Anna avait lieu de croire que son amie n'avait que des minutes de langueur et d'accablement, contre des heures d'activite et de distraction.	0.2575
How could it be?	Comment cela se pouvait-il !	0.0642857
She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.	Elle conclut que ce n'etait pas seulement de la force et de la resignation.	0.119048
A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.	Une ame soumise peut etre patiente ; une forte intelligence peut etre courageuse ; mais il y avait la quelque chose de plus : cette elasticite d'esprit.	-0.0377953
It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.	Cette disposition a etre consolee, cette faculte de trouver des occupations qui la detachaient d'elle-meme : tout cela venait de sa seule nature.	0.347581
There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly failed.	C'est le plus beau don du ciel, et Anna voyait la une grace speciale, destinee a remplacer tout le reste.	0.385962
She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her state on first reaching Bath.	Mme Shmith avait eu une epoque de profond decouragement.	0.134694
Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.	En arrivant a Bath, elle etait bien plus invalide qu'alors, car elle avait eu un refroidissement en voyage, et s'etait mise au lit, avec de vives et continuelles souffrances.	0.0387755
She had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her good.	Et cela parmi des etrangers, sans pouvoir se passer d'une garde, et dans une situation pecuniaire tres genee.	0.164062
It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.	Elle avait subi toutes ces choses et disait qu'il en etait resulte un bien.	0.295238
She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.	Elle s'etait sentie en bonnes mains. ~~~ Elle connaissait trop le monde pour attendre un attachement soudain et desinteresse ; mais sa proprietaire s'etait montree tres bonne, et la soeur de cette dame, garde-malade et alors sans emploi, l'avait admirablement soignee, et avait ete pour elle une amie precieuse.	-0.043346
"And she," said Mrs Smith, "besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.	<< Aussitot que je pus faire usage de mes mains, elle me montra a tricoter, ce qui me fut une grande distraction, et a faire ces paniers, ces pelotes et ces porte-cartes avec lesquels vous me trouvez si occupee.	0.221151
As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.	Ils me fournissent les moyens de faire un peu de bien a quelques pauvres familles du voisinage.	-0.0866667
She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.	>> Ma garde dispose de mes marchandises, et les fait acheter a ses clients.	0.290476
She always takes the right time for applying.	Elle saisit toujours le bon moment.	0.222581
Everybody's heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak.	Vous savez que quand on a echappe a un grand danger, on a le coeur plus ouvert, et Mme Rock sait quand il faut parler.	0.110526
She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.	C'est une femme habile, sensee et intelligente, qui comprend la nature humaine.	0.0825
Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.	Elle a un fond de bon sens et d'observation qui la rend infiniment superieure, comme compagne, a un millier de celles qui, ayant recu la meilleure education, ne trouvent rien digne d'elles.	0.379931
Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that makes one know one's species better.	Appelez cela commerage, si vous voulez ; mais quand la garde Rock a une demi-heure de loisir a me donner, je suis sure qu'elle me dira quelque chose d'amusant et d'utile, quelque chose qui nous fait mieux connaitre nos semblables.	0.360127
One likes to hear what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.	On aime a savoir ce qui se passe et quelle est la plus nouvelle maniere d'etre frivole et vain.	0.288462
To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat."	Pour moi, qui vis seule, sa conversation est une fete.	0.195652
Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, "I can easily believe it. ~~~ Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.	-- Je vous crois aisement ; les femmes de cette classe voient et entendent bien des choses, et si elles sont intelligentes, elles valent la peine d'etre ecoutees.	-0.0264706
Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!	Elles voient la nature humaine non pas seulement dans ses folies, mais dans les circonstances les plus interessantes et les plus touchantes.	0.204116
And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting.	Combien d'exemples passent sous leurs yeux, d'attachements ardents, desinteresses et devoues ; d'heroisme, de courage, de patience et de resignation !	0.29771
What instances must pass before them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation: of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most.	Combien d'exemples des plus nobles sacrifices !	-0.260714
A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes."	Une chambre de malade peut fournir matiere a des volumes.	0.287234
"Yes," said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.	-- Oui, dit Mme Shmith d'un air de doute ; cela peut arriver, mais pas dans le sens eleve que vous dites.	0.204706
Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.	Par-ci par-la la nature humaine peut etre grande en temps d'epreuves, mais en general c'est sa faiblesse et non sa force qui se montre dans une chambre de malade. ~~~ On y entend parler d'egoisme et d'impatience plus que de generosite et de courage.	-0.000731707
There is so little real friendship in the world!	Il y a si peu de reelle amitie dans le monde !	0.258333
and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) "there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late."	et malheureusement, dit-elle d'une voix basse et tremblante, il y en a tant qui oublient de penser serieusement jusqu'a ce qu'il soit trop tard.	0.261111
Anne saw the misery of such feelings.	>> Anna vit la souffrance cachee sous ces paroles.	0.196875
The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.	Le mari n'avait pas fait son devoir, et la femme avait ete conduite dans une societe qui lui avait donne sur les hommes une plus mauvaise opinion qu'ils ne le meritaient.	0.274615
It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a different tone-- "I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me.	Mme Shmith secoua cette emotion momentanee et ajouta bientot d'un ton different : << La situation actuelle de mon amie Mme Rock n'a rien en ce moment qui puisse m'interesser beaucoup.	0.52086
She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery.	Elle garde Mme Wallis, de Marlboroug-Buildings, femme tres jolie, tres mondaine, sotte et depensiere, et naturellement elle ne pourra parler que de dentelles et de chiffons.	0.285906
I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis, however.	Je veux cependant tirer parti de Mme Wallis.	0.284211
She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have in hand now."	Elle est tres riche, et il faut qu'elle achete toutes les choses cheres que j'ai en ce moment.	0.288462
Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place.	>> Anna etait allee plusieurs fois chez son amie avant que l'existence de celle-ci fut connue a Camben-Place.	0.451301
At last, it became necessary to speak of her.	A la fin, il fallut en parler.	0.144
Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings.	Sir Walter, Elisabeth et Mme Clay revinrent un matin de Laura-Place avec une invitation imprevue de lady Dalrymph pour cette meme soiree qu'Anna devait passer chez son amie.	0.536875
She was not sorry for the excuse. ~~~ They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow."	Elle etait certaine que lady Dalrymph les invitait parce qu'etant retenue chez elle par un refroidissement, elle etait bien aise d'user de la parente qui s'etait imposee a elle. ~~~ Anna s'excusa en disant qu'elle etait invitee chez une amie de pension.	-0.168396
They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe. ~~~ "Westgate Buildings!"

What is her age?	Quel age a-t-elle ?	0.235714
Forty?"	Quarante ans !	0.1125
"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself.	-- Seulement trente et un. ~~~ Mais je ne crois pas pouvoir remettre ma visite, parce que c'est la seule soiree qui nous convienne a toutes deux.	-0.0226891

"She sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary, she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith."	-- Elle n'y voit rien a blamer ; au contraire, elle l'approuve, et m'y a souvent conduite dans sa voiture.	0.194318
"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement," observed Sir Walter.	-- Westgate-Buildings a du etre surpris de voir un equipage sur ses paves, fit observer Sir Walter.	0.692857
"Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms, but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot.

A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings! ~~~ A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland!		-0.3
Mrs Smith!	Mme veuve Shmith !	0.12
Such a name!"	demeurant a Westgate-Buildings !	0.6
Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her.	Une pauvre veuve, ayant a peine de quoi vivre !	-0.6
She made no reply.	entre trente et quarante ans !	0.1125
She left it to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.	une simple Mme Shmith est l'amie intime de miss Elliot, qui la prefere a sa noble parente d'Ecosse et d'Irlande ; Mme Shmith !	0.225
Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.	quel nom ! ~~~ >> A ce moment, Mme Clay jugea convenable de quitter la chambre.	-0.107812
She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves, but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her.		-0.3
Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.	Anna aurait bien voulu prendre la defense de son amie, mais elle se tut, par respect pour son pere.	0.258333
To her, its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.	Elle le laissa se souvenir que Mme Shmith n'etait pas la seule veuve a Bath, entre trente et quarante ans, ayant peu de fortune et ne possedant aucun titre de noblesse.	0.322527
Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.	Elle tint son engagement, et les autres tinrent le leur. ~~~ Il va sans dire que, le lendemain, elle entendit raconter la delicieuse soiree.	-0.0255
He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.	Sir Walter et Elisabeth s'etaient empresses d'inviter, de la part de sa seigneurie, lady Russel et M. Elliot.	0.296739
He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create.	Celui-ci avait laisse la le colonel Wallis pour venir, et lady Russel etait venue, quoiqu'elle eut deja dispose autrement de sa soiree. ~~~ Par elle, Anna sut tout ce qui s'etait dit.	-0.0671053
Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.	Son amie et M. Elliot avaient cause d'elle.	0.137838
She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.		-0.3
She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.	On l'avait desiree, regrettee ; on avait approuve le motif de son absence ; sa bonne et affectueuse visite a une ancienne compagne malade et pauvre avait ravi M. Elliot.	0.308442
Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed, and gently shook her head.	Il trouvait, comme lady Russel, qu'Anna etait une jeune fille extraordinaire, un modele de perfection en tous genres.	0.251724
"I am no match-maker, as you well know," said Lady Russell, "being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.	Anna ne pouvait se savoir si hautement appreciee par un galant homme sans eprouver les emotions que lady Russel cherchait a faire naitre.	0.289655
I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.	Celle-ci avait son opinion faite sur M. Elliot. ~~~ Elle etait convaincue qu'il recherchait Anna, et le trouvait digne d'elle.	-0.0728972
A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be a very happy one."	Elle calculait combien de semaines lui restaient jusqu'a la fin de son deuil, pour qu'il put deployer toutes ses seductions.	0.207407
"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I think highly of him," said Anne; "but we should not suit."	Elle ne dit qu'a demi ce qu'elle pensait, hasardant seulement quelques mots sur la possibilite d'une telle alliance.	0.288
Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.		-0.3
You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!	Anna l'ecoutait en rougissant, et secouait doucement la tete. ~~~ << Je ne suis pas une faiseuse de mariages, vous le savez, dit lady Russel.	-0.105128
My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life!"	Je connais trop bien l'incertitude des previsions humaines.	0.203774
Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table, and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings this picture excited.	Je dis seulement que si M. Elliot vous recherchait et que vous fussiez disposee a l'accepter, il y aurait la des elements de bonheur.	0.357838
For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched.	-- M. Elliot est un homme tres aimable, et que j'estime beaucoup, mais nous ne nous convenons pas.	0.144444
The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of having the precious name of "Lady Elliot" first revived in herself; of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.	>> Lady Russel repondit seulement : << J'avoue que ma plus grande joie serait de vous voir la maitresse de Kellynch, la future lady Elliot, occupant la place de votre chere mere, succedant a tous ses droits, a sa popularite, a toutes ses vertus.	0.431856
Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anne did not believe.	Vous etes le portrait de votre mere, ma chere Anna, au physique et au moral, et si vous preniez sa place, votre seule superiorite sur elle serait d'etre plus justement appreciee qu'elle ne le fut.	0.246626
The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again. ~~~ The charm of Kellynch and of "Lady Elliot" all faded away.	>> Anna se leva et s'eloigna pour se remettre de l'emotion que cette peinture excitait en elle : son imagination et son coeur etaient seduits.	0
She never could accept him.	Toutes ces images avaient un charme irresistible.	0.05
And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot.	Lady Russel n'ajouta pas un mot, laissant Anna a ses reflexions, et se disant que si M. Elliot plaidait en ce moment sa cause......	0.315413
Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character.	En resume, elle croyait ce qu'Anna ne croyait pas encore.	0.0489796
That he was a sensible man, an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.	Celle-ci, venant a penser a M. Elliot plaidant lui-meme sa cause, se trouva subitement refroidie, et se dit qu'elle ne l'accepterait jamais.	0.50837
He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct. ~~~ She distrusted the past, if not the present.	Quoiqu'elle le frequentat depuis un mois, elle ne pouvait dire qu'elle le connaissait ; elle voyait bien que c'etait un homme sense, aimable, qu'il causait bien, et professait de bonnes opinions.	-0.0126506
The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.	Il avait le sentiment du devoir, et elle ne pouvait le trouver en defaut sur aucun point, mais cependant elle n'aurait pas voulu repondre de lui.	0.255372
She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?		-0.3
How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?	Elle se mefiait du passe, sinon du present.	0.145946
Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open. ~~~ There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of others.	Quelques mots prononces parfois lui donnaient des soupcons ; et qui pouvait repondre des sentiments d'un homme habile et prudent, qui feignait peut-etre d'etre ce qu'il n'etait pas ?	-0.0114583
This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection. ~~~ Her early impressions were incurable.	M. Elliot n'etait pas ouvert : le bien ou le mal n'excitait en lui aucun elan de plaisir ou d'indignation.	-0.0333333
She prized the frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.	Pour Anna, c'etait un grand defaut : elle adorait la franchise et l'enthousiasme.	0.291176
Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still. ~~~ She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind never varied, whose tongue never slipped.	Elle se fiait plus a la sincerite de ceux qui disent parfois une parole irreflechie qu'a ceux dont la presence d'esprit ne fait jamais defaut, et dont la langue ne se trompe jamais.	0.0662353
Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable. ~~~ Various as were the tempers in her father's house, he pleased them all.	M. Elliot savait plaire a tous ; il lui avait parle ouvertement de Mme Clay, et cependant il etait aussi aimable avec elle qu'avec toute autre.	-0.0378947
He endured too well, stood too well with every body.	Lady Russel en voyait plus ou moins que sa jeune amie, car elle n'avait aucune defiance.	0.0954545
He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.	Elle ne pouvait imaginer un homme plus parfait, et rien ne lui eut ete plus doux que de voir sa bien-aimee Anna lui donner la main dans l'eglise de Kellynch, au prochain automne.	0.269388
Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she saw nothing to excite distrust.	CHAPITRE XVIII On etait au commencement de fevrier.	0.0466667
She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.		-0.3
Chapter 18 It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.	Anna etait depuis un mois a Bath, et attendait impatiemment des nouvelles d'Uppercross et de Lyme.	0.711555
She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated. ~~~ It was three weeks since she had heard at all.	Depuis trois semaines elle n'en avait pas recu : elle savait seulement qu'Henriette etait de retour a la maison et que Louisa etait encore a Lyme.	-0.0603448
She only knew that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs Croft's compliments.		-0.3
The Crofts must be in Bath! ~~~ A circumstance to interest her. ~~~ They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.	Elle y pensait un soir plus que de coutume, quand une lettre de Marie lui fut remise avec les compliments de M. et Mme Croft.	-0.130769

I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.	Neanmoins, j'aurais en tout cas visite les Croft.	0.251163
I know what is due to my tenant."		-0.3
Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.		-0.3
It had been begun several days back.	Je sais ce que je dois a mon locataire.	0.290323
"February 1st." ~~~ "My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.	>> << Ma chere Anna, disait la lettre, je ne m'excuse pas de mon silence, parce qu'on ne doit guere se soucier des lettres a Bath.	0.174118
You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords little to write about.	Vous etes trop heureuse pour penser a Uppercross.	0.277519
We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.	Notre Noel a ete tres triste, les Musgrove n'ont pas donne un seul diner. ~~~ Je ne compte pas les Hayter.	0.143443
I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.	Les vacances sont enfin finies.	0.246429
The holidays, however, are over at last: I believe no children ever had such long ones.	Nous n'en avons jamais eu d'aussi longues quand nous etions enfants.	0.228814
I am sure I had not. ~~~ The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.	La maison a ete debarrassee hier, excepte des petits Harville, et vous serez surprise d'apprendre qu'ils ne sont pas venus chez moi une seule fois.	-0.00245902
Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.	Mme Harville est une etrange mere de s'en separer si longtemps.	0.526
I do not understand it. ~~~ They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.	Ce ne sont pas de jolis enfants, mais Mme Musgrove semble les aimer autant et meme plus que les siens.	0.0160714
What dreadful weather we have had!	<< Quel affreux temps nous avons eu !	0.29
It may not be felt in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.	Vous ne vous en apercevez pas a Bath avec vos paves propres. ~~~ A la campagne, c'est autre chose.	-0.001875
I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.	<< Je n'ai pas eu une seule visite depuis la deuxieme semaine de janvier, excepte Charles Hayter, qui est venu trop souvent.	0.514716
Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.	<< Entre nous, c'est grand dommage qu'Henriette ne soit pas restee a Lyme aussi longtemps que Louisa, cela l'aurait tenue loin de lui.	0.54469
The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.	La voiture vient de partir pour ramener demain Louisa et les Harville.	0.515769
We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.	Nous ne sommes invites a diner avec eux que le surlendemain, tant on craint la fatigue du voyage pour Louisa, ce qui n'est pas probable si l'on pense aux soins dont elle est l'objet. ~~~ J'aimerais bien mieux y diner demain.	-0.0293478
I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have my usual luck: I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.	<< Je suis bien aise que vous trouviez M. Elliot si aimable, et je voudrais le connaitre aussi.	0.0857428
What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!	Mais j'ai la mauvaise chance de n'etre jamais la quand il y a quelque chose d'agreable.	0.186792
Does she never mean to go away?	Je suis la derniere de la famille dont on s'occupe.	0.103846
But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.	<< Quel temps immense Mme Clay passe avec Elisabeth !	0.193333
Let me know what you think of this.	A-t-elle l'intention de s'en aller jamais ?	0.206897
I do not expect my children to be asked, you know.	Pensez-vous que nous serions invites si elle laissait la place libre ?	0.160976
I can leave them at the Great House very well, for a month or six weeks.	Je puis tres bien laisser mes enfants a Great-House pendant un mois ou six semaines.	0.607759
I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.	<< J'ai entendu dire que les Croft partaient pour Bath : ils n'ont pas eu l'attention de demander mes commissions ; ils ne sont guere polis !	0.367582
Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.		-0.3
I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.		-0.3
We see nothing of them, and this is really an instance of gross inattention.	Nous les voyons a peine, et c'est reellement de leur part un manque d'egards.	0.295312
Charles joins me in love, and everything proper.	<< Charles se joint a moi pour vous dire mille choses amicales.	0.554762

I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are always worse than anybody's."		-0.3
So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope, containing nearly as much more.	Je crois que j'en aurai une, car mes maux de gorge sont toujours plus dangereux que ceux des autres.	0.281928
"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.	>> Ainsi finissait la premiere partie, a laquelle avait ete ajoute ceci : << J'ai laisse ma lettre ouverte afin de vous dire comment Louisa a supporte le voyage ; et j'en suis tres contente, car j'ai beaucoup a ajouter.	0.317233
In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like.	D'abord j'ai recu hier un mot de Mme Croft, demandant si j'avais quelque chose a vous envoyer : une lettre tres bonne, tres amicale, et adressee a moi, comme cela doit etre.	0.395804
The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.	L'amiral ne semble pas tres malade, et j'espere sincerement que Bath lui fera du bien.	0.466952
I shall be truly glad to have them back again. ~~~ Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family. ~~~ But now for Louisa.	Je serai vraiment heureuse quand ils reviendront : nous ne pouvons pas nous passer d'une si aimable famille.	-0.105747
I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.	<< Maintenant, parlons de Louisa : vous serez bien etonnee.	0.258824
She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?		-0.3
Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.		-0.3
True, upon my honour!	Elle est arrivee mardi.	0.268421
Are not you astonished? ~~~ I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.	Le soir, en allant prendre de ses nouvelles, nous fumes surpris de ne pas trouver Benwick, car il avait ete invite aussi.	-0.0241379
Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.	Et devinez-vous pourquoi il n'y etait pas ?	0.12973
We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.		-0.3
Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.	Il fait la cour a Louisa, et n'a pas voulu venir avant d'avoir recu la reponse de M. Musgrove a sa demande ecrite.	0.498387
Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her.	Je serais surprise que vous sachiez cela, car on ne m'en a rien dit.	0.203571
Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see anything of it.	Nous sommes tres contents, car ce mariage, quoique moins bon que celui du capitaine Wenvorth, est un million de fois meilleur que celui de Charles Hayter.	0.390385
And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.		-0.3
How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.	M. Musgrove a donne son consentement.	0.383117
I hope he will be more agreeable now.	On attend le capitaine Benwick.	0.267857
Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters."	<< Charles se demande ce que dira Wenvorth mais vous vous souvenez que je n'ai jamais cru a son attachement pour Louisa.	0.435314
	<< Et voila la fin de la supposition que Benwick etait votre adorateur !	-0.3
Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared for the news.	<< Il est incomprehensible pour moi que Charles ait pu se mettre cela dans la tete.	0.295588
She had never in her life been more astonished.	>> Jamais Anna ne fut plus surprise.	0.212903

It was almost too wonderful for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the moment.		-0.3
Happily for her, they were not many.	C'etait trop etonnant pour le croire.	0.280645
Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.

"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this."	Mais, a l'age de l'amiral et avec sa profession, il ne doit pas manquer de connaissances dans une ville comme Bath.	0.450852
"I suspect," said Sir Walter coolly, "that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.	-- Je pense, dit posement Sir Walter, que l'amiral sera connu ici comme locataire de Kellynch.	0.416471
Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?" ~~~ "Oh, no!	Elisabeth, pouvons-nous nous aventurer a les presenter a Laura-Place ?	-0.00762712
I think not. ~~~ Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins, we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve.	-- Je ne crois pas ; nous sommes cousins de lady Dalrymph, et nous ne devons pas lui imposer des connaissances qu'elle pourrait desapprouver. ~~~ Il vaut mieux laisser les Croft avec leurs egaux.	-0.153879
If we were not related, it would not signify; but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.	>> Ce fut tout l'interet qu'Elisabeth prit a la lettre de Marie, et quand Mme Clay se fut informee poliment de Mme Musgrove et de ses charmants enfants, on laissa Anna tranquille.	0.129474
We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.	Une fois dans sa chambre, elle chercha a comprendre.	0.293333
There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.	Peut-etre Wenvorth, s'apercevant qu'il n'aimait pas Louisa, s'etait-il retire ?	0.295714
The Crofts will associate with them."	Elle ne pouvait admettre l'idee de legerete ou de trahison.	0.136364
This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter; when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was at liberty.		-0.3
In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.	Le capitaine Benwick et Louisa Musgrove !	0.291667
Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel!	La vive et gaie Louisa, et le triste et sentimental Benwick !	0.294118
Perhaps he had quitted the field, had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.	les derniers entre tous qui semblaient se convenir !	0.0266667
She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend.	Mais ils s'etaient trouves ensemble pendant plusieurs semaines ; ils avaient vecu dans le meme petit cercle.	0.296739
She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly. ~~~ Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!	Louisa relevant de maladie etait plus interessante, et Benwick moins inconsolable.	0.318182
The high-spirited, joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.	Anna, au lieu de tirer du present les memes conclusions que Marie, soupconnait que Benwick avait eu un commencement d'inclination pour elle.	0.2175
Their minds most dissimilar!	Mais elle n'en tirait point vanite.	0.242308
Where could have been the attraction? ~~~ The answer soon presented itself.	Benwick lui avait ete reconnaissant de la sympathie qu'elle lui avait montree.	-0.009375
It had been in situation.	Il avait un coeur aimant.	0.3
They had been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same small family party: since Henrietta's coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.		-0.3
That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.		-0.3
She did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary might have allowed.		-0.3
She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment.	Elle pensait qu'ils pouvaient etre heureux : lui gagnerait de la gaite, elle de l'enthousiasme pour Byron ou Walter Scott.	0.253846
He had an affectionate heart. ~~~ He must love somebody. ~~~ She saw no reason against their being happy.	Mais c'etait deja fait probablement ; la poesie avait rapproche leurs coeurs.	-0.113559
Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.	L'idee de Louisa, devenue personne litteraire et sentimentale, etait amusante.	0.291176
He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they had fallen in love over poetry.		-0.3
The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.	L'accident arrive a Lyme avait pu avoir une influence sur sa sante et son caractere aussi bien que sur sa destinee.	0.358239
The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate.		-0.3
The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing to be regretted.		-0.3
No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.	Non, ce n'etait pas le regret qui, en depit d'elle-meme, faisait battre le coeur d'Anna et lui mettait la rougeur aux joues, quand elle pensait que Wenvorth etait libre !	0.394647
She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.	Elle avait honte d'analyser ses sentiments.	0.207692
They were too much like joy, senseless joy!	Ils ressemblaient trop a de la joie : une joie immense.	0.227027
She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.		-0.3
The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.		-0.3
The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction.	Les Croft, a la parfaite satisfaction de Sir Walter, se logerent dans Gay-Street.	0.445714
He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.	Des lors il ne rougit pas de les connaitre, et parla beaucoup plus de l'amiral que celui-ci n'avait jamais parle de lui.	0.189
The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form, and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.	Les Croft apportaient a Bath leur habitude de province d'etre toujours ensemble.	0.367253
They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.	La marche etait ordonnee a l'amiral pour guerir sa goutte, et Anna les rencontrait partout.	0.24
He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.		-0.3
Anne saw them wherever she went.	Ils etaient pour elle l'image du bonheur.	0.214286
Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.	Elle les suivait longtemps des yeux, ravie de pouvoir s'imaginer ce qu'ils disaient marchant cote a cote, heureux et independants ; ou de voir quelle cordiale poignee de mains l'amiral donnait a un ami, et le groupe anime qu'il formait parfois avec d'autres marins.	-0.0137615
Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her.	Mme Croft, au milieu d'eux, paraissait aussi intelligente et aussi fine qu'aucun des officiers qui l'entouraient.	0.198649
She always watched them as long as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.		-0.3
Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.		-0.3
He was standing by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice.	Un matin, Anna, traversant Milton-Street, rencontra l'amiral ; il etait seul, et si occupe a regarder des gravures, qu'il ne la vit pas d'abord.	0.22082
When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour. ~~~ "Ha!	Quand il l'eut apercue, il dit avec sa bonne humeur habituelle : << Ah !	-0.0813559
is it you?	c'est vous.	0.233333
Thank you, thank you. ~~~ This is treating me like a friend. ~~~ Here I am, you see, staring at a picture.	Vous me voyez plante devant ce tableau : je ne puis passer ici sans m'y arreter.	-0.102586
I can never get by this shop without stopping.		-0.3
But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!	Mais est-ce la un bateau ?	0.136364
Do look at it.	Regardez.	0.24
Did you ever see the like?	En avez-vous jamais vu un pareil ?	0.204545
What queer fellows your fine painters must be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that?	Vos peintres sont etonnants, s'ils croient qu'on voudrait risquer sa vie dans cette vieille coquille de noix informe.	0.252475
And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be.		-0.3
I wonder where that boat was built!" ~~~ (laughing heartily); "I would not venture over a horsepond in it.	Et cependant, voila deux personnages qui y semblent parfaitement a l'aise.	0.100893
Well," (turning away), "now, where are you bound? ~~~ Can I go anywhere for you, or with you?	Ils regardent les rochers et les montagnes comme s'ils n'allaient pas etre culbutes, ce qui arrivera certainement.	-0.0453947
Can I be of any use?"	Maintenant, ou allez-vous ?	0.158824
"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together.		-0.3
I am going home." ~~~ "That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.	Puis-je vous accompagner, ou faire quelque chose pour vous ?	-0.0173077
Yes, yes we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go along.		-0.3
There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there. ~~~ Lord!	-- Non, merci, a moins de faire route avec moi.	0.00944056
what a boat it is!"	Je vais a la maison.	0.78125
taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.	-- Certainement, de tout mon coeur.	0.0870968
"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?" ~~~ "Yes, I have, presently.	Nous ferons une bonne promenade, et j'ai quelque chose a vous dire.	-0.0263158
But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I shall only say, 'How d'ye do?'	Prenez mon bras ; je ne me sens pas a l'aise si je n'ai pas le bras d'une femme.	0.495161
as we pass, however.	-- Vous avez quelque chose a me dire ?	0.0833333
I shall not stop. ~~~ 'How d'ye do?'	-- Oui ; mais voici un ami, le capitaine Bridgdem.	-0.0672414
Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.	Je veux seulement lui demander comment il va, en passant.	0.25
She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.	Il est surpris de me voir avec une autre femme que la mienne.	0.0827586
She has a blister on one of her heels, as large as a three-shilling piece.	La pauvre ame est prise par la jambe ; elle a au talon une ampoule presque aussi large qu'une piece de cinq francs.	0.512705
If you look across the street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.	Voyez-vous l'amiral Brand qui vient vers nous avec son frere ?	0.442453
Shabby fellows, both of them! ~~~ I am glad they are not on this side of the way.	Habits rapes tous deux ; je suis content qu'ils soient de l'autre cote de la rue.	-0.00703125
Sophy cannot bear them.	Sophie ne peut pas les souffrir.	0.2
They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men.	Ils m'ont joue autrefois un vilain tour, je vous conterai cela.	0.277778
I will tell you the whole story another time.		-0.3
There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.	Voici le vieux Sir Archibald et son petit-fils.	0.937398
Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.	Regardez, il nous voit. ~~~ Il vous envoie un baiser, et vous prend pour ma femme.	-0.0294643
Ah!	Ah !	0.3
the peace has come too soon for that younker.	la paix est venue trop tot pour ce jeune homme.	0.292105
Poor old Sir Archibald!	Pauvre vieux Sir Archibald !	0.842857
How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?	<< Aimez-vous Bath, miss Elliot ?	0.728571
It suits us very well. ~~~ We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.		-0.3
We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.	Bath me convient tres bien ; nous rencontrons toujours quelque vieil ami.	0.128571
The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way."	On est sur de pouvoir bavarder, puis, rentres chez nous, nous nous plongeons dans nos fauteuils, et nous sommes aussi bien qu'a Kellynch.	-0.0327273
When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate.	>> Anna le pressa de lui dire ce qu'il avait a lui communiquer.	0.346978
She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.		-0.3
As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began-- "Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.	Mais elle fut obligee d'attendre, car l'amiral s'etait mis en tete de ne parler que sur la place Belmont.	0.2625
But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about. ~~~ That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned for.	<< Maintenant, dit-il, vous allez entendre quelque chose de surprenant ; mais d'abord dites-moi le nom de la cadette des misses Musgrove.	-0.0102564
The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.	Je l'oublie toujours. ~~~ >> Anna la nomma.	-0.0458333
Her Christian name: I always forget her Christian name."		-0.3
Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did; but now she could safely suggest the name of "Louisa."		-0.3
"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.	<< Oui, Louisa Musgrove, c'est cela.	1.07277
I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names. ~~~ I should never be out if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.	Si les jeunes filles n'avaient pas d'aussi beaux noms, et s'appelaient simplement Sophie ou Marie, je ne me tromperais jamais.	-0.0111111
Well, this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.	Eh bien ! ~~~ nous pensions que cette miss Louisa allait epouser Frederic.	0
He was courting her week after week.	Depuis quelque temps il lui faisait la cour.	0.232258
The only wonder was, what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.		-0.3
But even then there was something odd in their way of going on.	On se demandait seulement pourquoi ils attendaient, quand arriva l'accident de Lyme.	0.173077
Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see Edward.	Frederic, au lieu de rester a Lyme, alla a Plymouth, puis il partit pour aller voir Edouard, et il y est encore.	0.532456
When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since.		-0.3
We have seen nothing of him since November.	Nous ne l'avons pas vu depuis novembre.	0.273529
Even Sophy could not understand it. ~~~ But now, the matter has taken the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.	Sophie elle-meme n'y comprend rien, Mais aujourd'hui les choses ont pris le tour le plus etrange, car cette jeune miss Musgrove, au lieu d'epouser Frederic, se marie avec James Benwick.	0.123263
You know James Benwick."	Vous le connaissez ?	0.233333
"A little.	-- Un peu.	0.266667
I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."		-0.3
"Well, she is to marry him.		-0.3
Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for."	-- Eh bien, ils doivent etre maries deja, car je ne vois pas pourquoi ils attendraient.	0.3
"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man," said Anne, "and I understand that he bears an excellent character."	-- Le capitaine Benwick est un homme tres aimable, et on lui donne un excellent caractere.	0.542415
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.	oui, il n'y a rien a dire contre lui.	0.38
He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.	Il n'est commandant que de l'annee derniere, il est vrai, et le moment est mauvais pour avoir de l'avancement, mais je ne lui connais pas d'autre defaut.	0.254054
An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice."	C'est un excellent garcon, un officier actif et zele, plus que vous ne le croyez, peut-etre, car son air tranquille ne lui rend pas justice.	0.197436
"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick's manners.	-- Vous vous trompez, monsieur ; les manieres du capitaine ne me font pas supposer qu'il manque d'energie.	0.296629
I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please."	Je les trouve tres agreables, et je suis sure qu'elles plaisent generalement.	0.241791
"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.	-- Bien, bien ; les dames sont les meilleurs juges ; mais James Benwick est un peu trop tranquille pour moi.	0.296323
There is something about Frederick more to our taste." ~~~ Anne was caught.	C'est probablement l'effet de notre partialite, mais Sophie et moi, nous preferons les manieres de Frederic.	-0.0738095
She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say, "I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends," but the Admiral interrupted her with-- "And the thing is certainly true.	-- Je n'avais pas l'intention, dit Anna apres un peu d'hesitation, de comparer les deux amis. ~~~ >> Mais l'amiral l'interrompit : << La nouvelle du mariage est certainement vraie, il n'y a pas la de cancans.	-0.134302
It is not a mere bit of gossip.	Nous le savons par Frederic lui-meme, qui l'a ecrit a sa soeur.	0.297333
We have it from Frederick himself.	Je pense qu'ils sont tous a Uppercross ?	0.26
His sister had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.	>> Anna ne put resister a la tentation de dire : << J'espere, amiral, qu'il n'y a rien dans la lettre du capitaine qui puisse vous faire de peine.	0.469748
I fancy they are all at Uppercross." ~~~ This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore, "I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.		-0.3
It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally, and without violence.	Il semblait exister un attachement entre lui et Louisa a l'automne dernier ; mais j'aime a croire qu'il s'en est alle de part et d'autre sans dechirement !	0.354611
I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man."	J'espere que le capitaine n'a a se plaindre de personne.	0.25625
"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end."	-- Non, certainement ; Frederic n'est pas un homme a gemir et a se plaindre.	0.477976
Anne looked down to hide her smile.	Il a trop d'esprit pour cela.	0.24
"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much spirit for that.	Si la jeune fille en prefere un autre, qu'elle le prenne.	0.15625
If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him." ~~~ "Certainly.	-- Vous avez raison ; j'espere seulement que le capitaine n'a pas a se plaindre de son ami.	-0.00202703
But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without its being absolutely said.		-0.3
I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."	Je serais bien fachee que leur amitie fut detruite, ou meme refroidie par une chose semblable.	0.0825
"Yes, yes, I understand you.	-- Oui, oui, je vous comprends.	0.276
But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter.	Mais sa lettre n'en dit rien.	0.036
He does not give the least fling at Benwick; does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.'		-0.3
No, you would not guess, from his way of writing, that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?)	Il ne temoigne pas meme le plus leger etonnement.	-0.0214286
for himself. ~~~ He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that, I think."		-0.3
Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.		-0.3
She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.		-0.3
"Poor Frederick!" ~~~ said he at last.	>> Anna ne fut pas aussi convaincue que l'amiral.	-0.046875
"Now he must begin all over again with somebody else.	Mais il etait inutile d'en demander davantage.	0.270732
I think we must get him to Bath. ~~~ Sophy must write, and beg him to come to Bath.	<< Pauvre Frederic, dit l'amiral ; il faut qu'il recommence a nouveaux frais.	-0.00230769
Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.	Sophie doit lui ecrire de venir ; il y a ici de jolies filles, il me semble.	0.0617647
It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.	Il serait inutile d'aller a Uppercross a present, car l'autre miss Musgrove est recherchee par son cousin, le jeune ministre.	0.582884
Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?"	Ne pensez-vous pas, miss Elliot, qu'il fera mieux de venir a Bath ?	0.514286
Chapter 19 While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither.	>> CHAPITRE XIX Tandis que l'amiral parlait de Wenvorth, celui-ci etait deja en route.	0.00405405
Before Mrs Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.	Anna l'apercut la premiere fois qu'elle sortit.	0.0214286
Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay. ~~~ They were in Milsom Street.	Elle etait avec sa soeur, M. Elliot et Mme Clay ; on traversait la rue Nelson, il commencait a pleuvoir.	-0.00030303
It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance.	Les dames entrerent dans un magasin, tandis que M. Elliot s'avancait vers lady Dalrymph, dont la voiture stationnait a quelques pas de la, et lui demandait de prendre ces dames.	0.149253
He soon joined them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.	Mais la caleche ne contenait que quatre places, et miss Carteret etait avec sa mere.	0.0929577
Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four with any comfort.	Une place appartenait de droit a miss Elliot l'ainee ; mais il y eut un debat de politesse entre Mme Clay et Anna, pour la seconde place.	0.328471
Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies.	Anna se souciait peu de la pluie et preferait marcher ; Mme Clay ne la craignait pas non plus, et etait d'ailleurs solidement chaussee.	0.3
There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot. ~~~ Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two.	Mais miss Elliot affirma que Mme Clay avait deja pris froid ; et M. Elliot soutint que les bottines d'Anna etaient les plus solides ; cela mit fin au debat.	-0.0141026
The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.	Tout a coup, Anna, assise pres de la fenetre, apercut Wenvorth, qui descendait la rue.	0.48339
But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick!	Elle ne put s'empecher de tressaillir, tout en se disant que c'etait absurde.	0.15
much thicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the thickest.		-0.3
It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain Wentworth walking down the street.		-0.3
Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and absurd!		-0.3
For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was all confusion.	Pendant quelques minutes, elle ne vit rien ; tout etait confus autour d'elle.	0.246429
She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay's.	Quand elle put se remettre, on attendait encore la voiture, et M. Elliot s'appretait a faire une commission pour Mme Clay.	0.650309
She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to see if it rained.		-0.3
Why was she to suspect herself of another motive?	Elle alla vers la porte pour voir s'il pleuvait.	0.292683
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.	Quel autre motif aurait-elle eu ?	0.248276
She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.		-0.3
She would see if it rained.	Le capitaine devait etre parti ?	0.234783
She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street.		-0.3
He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite red.	Elle rebroussa chemin en voyant entrer le capitaine Wenvorth lui-meme avec plusieurs dames et gentlemen.	0.28022
For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.		-0.3
She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.	La vue d'Anna parut le troubler ; il rougit extremement.	0.225
All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise were over with her.	Pour la premiere fois, elle trahissait moins d'emotion que lui.	0.136364
Still, however, she had enough to feel!		-0.3
It was agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.	Elle avait pu se preparer, et pourtant elle etait emue.	0.191489
He spoke to her, and then turned away.	Il lui dit quelques mots.	0.163636
The character of his manner was embarrassment.	Il n'etait ni froid ni amical, mais embarrasse.	0.3
She could not have called it either cold or friendly, or anything so certainly as embarrassed.	Anna vit avec peine, mais sans surprise, qu'Elisabeth ne voulait pas reconnaitre M. Wenvorth.	0.29625
After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.		-0.3
Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed: neither of them, probably, much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly.		-0.3
They had by dint of being so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.		-0.3
Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him. ~~~ There was consciousness of some sort or other.	Il n'attendait qu'un signe d'elle pour la saluer, mais elle se detourna avec une froideur glaciale.	-0.0054878
He looked very well, not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross, of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was.		-0.3
It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him.	Bientot un domestique annonca la voiture de lady Dalrymph.	0.176471
She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance, expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness.		-0.3
Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.		-0.3
It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.	La pluie recommencait ; il y eut dans la petite boutique un mouvement qui apprit aux assistants que lady Dalrymph venait chercher miss Elliot.	0.2875
At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.	Alors le capitaine, se tournant vers Anna, lui offrit ses services plutot par son attitude que par ses paroles.	0.0861702
"I am much obliged to you," was her answer, "but I am not going with them.	<< Je vous remercie, dit-elle.	-0.0666667
The carriage would not accommodate so many. ~~~ I walk: I prefer walking."	Je ne monte pas en voiture ; il n'y a pas de place, et je prefere marcher.	-0.00762712
"But it rains."	pa -- Mais il pleut.	0.235714
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
very little, Nothing that I regard."	tres peu ; je n'y prends pas garde >>.	0.290323
After a moment's pause he said: "Though I came only yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see," (pointing to a new umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair."		-0.3
She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding, "I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.	Apres un silence, il dit, en montrant son parapluie : << Quoique arrive d'hier, je me suis deja equipe pour Bath.	0.140426
He will be here in a moment, I am sure."	Prenez-le si vous tenez a marcher ; mais il serait plus prudent de me laisser chercher une voiture.	0.0946023
She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.	>> Elle refusa, disant qu'elle attendait M. Elliot.	0.28
Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.	Elle parlait encore quand il entra.	0.203226
There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend.	Wenvorth le reconnut, c'etait bien celui qu'il avait vu a Lyme s'arreter sur l'escalier pour admirer Anna.	0.089011
He came in with eagerness, appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a "Good morning to you!"	Sa maniere d'etre et ses facons etaient celles d'un parent, ou d'un ami privilegie. ~~~ Il lui offrit son bras.	-0.313043
being all that she had time for, as she passed away.	En sortant, Anna ne put jeter a Wenvorth qu'un bonjour, accompagne d'un doux et timide regard.	0.0418605
As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's party began talking of them.	Quand ils furent partis, les dames qui etaient avec le capitaine se mirent a parler d'eux.	0.280263
"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?"	<< Miss Elliot ne deplait pas a son cousin, je crois ?	0.885714
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
no, that is clear enough.	c'est assez clair.	0.211765
One can guess what will happen there.	On peut deviner ce qui arrivera.	0.257143
He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.	Il est toujours avec eux. ~~~ Il vit a moitie dans la famille.	0
What a very good-looking man!"	Il a tres bon air.	0.56
"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with."	-- Oui, et miss Atkinson, qui a dine une fois avec lui, dit qu'elle n'a jamais vu un homme plus aimable.	0.358717
"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to look at her.	-- Quand on regarde bien miss Elliot, on la trouve jolie.	0.18125
It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire her more than her sister."	J'avoue que je la prefere a sa soeur, malgre l'avis general.	0.211765
"Oh! ~~~ so do I."	-- Moi aussi.	-0.025
"And so do I.	-- Oh !	0.05
No comparison.	sans comparaison.	0.235714
But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.	Mais les hommes sont tous enthousiastes de miss Elliot.	0.5
Anne is too delicate for them."	Anna est trop delicate pour eux.	0.71746
Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.		-0.3
She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.		-0.3
But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth.	>> Anna aurait bien voulu ne pas causer.	0.185294
She could not understand his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled, she could not be quite herself.	Son cousin etait plein d'attention, et choisissait des sujets propres a l'interesser, soit des louanges sensees et justes de lady Russel, soit des insinuations contre Mme Clay.	0.3
She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas!	Mais Anna ne pouvait en ce moment penser qu'a Wenvorth.	0.286667
alas! ~~~ she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.	Elle ne pouvait deviner ce qu'il pensait, ni etre calme.	-0.01
Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not recollect it.		-0.3
He might be only passing through.	Elle esperait etre sage et raisonnable plus tard ; mais, helas !	0.0413793
But it was more probable that he should be come to stay.	elle devait s'avouer qu'elle ne l'etait pas encore.	0.293333
In that case, so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere.	S'il restait a Bath, lady Russel ne pouvait manquer de le voir.	0.24775
Would she recollect him?	Le reconnaitrait-elle ?	0.3
How would it all be?	Qu'en resulterait-il ?	0.229412
She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick.	Deja elle avait du dire a son amie que Louisa allait epouser Benwick et avait ete genee en voyant la surprise de lady Russel, qui ne connaissait pas bien la situation.	0.279608
It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.	Le lendemain, Anna, en descendant la rue Pulleney avec lady Russel, apercut Wenvorth sur le trottoir oppose, et ne le perdit plus de vue.	0.0834783
The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street.		-0.3
There were many other men about him, many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.	Quand il fut plus pres, elle regarda lady Russel et vit qu'elle observait attentivement Wenvorth.	0.296429
She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.	A la difficulte qu'elle avait a en detacher ses yeux, Anna comprit qu'il exercait sur lady Russel une sorte de fascination.	0.281633
No, it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite.	Elle paraissait etonnee que huit annees passees dans des pays etrangers et dans le service actif ne lui eussent rien enleve de sa bonne mine.	0.168293
She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out, though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--of her being, in short, intently observing him.		-0.3
She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's mind, the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace!	A la fin, lady Russel detourna la tete : << Vous vous demandez sans doute ce qui a arrete mes yeux si longtemps : je regardais a une fenetre des rideaux dont lady Alis m'a parle.	0.0166667
At last, Lady Russell drew back her head. ~~~ "Now, how would she speak of him?"	>> Anna soupira et rougit de pitie et de dedain soit pour son amie, soit pour elle-meme.	-0.0184615
"You will wonder," said she, "what has been fixing my eye so long; but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.		-0.3
They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description."		-0.3
Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her friend or herself.	Ce qui la vexait le plus, c'est qu'elle n'avait pu s'assurer s'il les avait apercues.	0.2875
The part which provoked her most, was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them. ~~~ A day or two passed without producing anything.	Un jour ou deux se passerent sans le voir, et Anna, s'imaginant plus forte qu'elle n'etait, attendait avec impatience un concert donne pour le benefice d'une personne patronnee par lady Dalrymph.	-0.00451807
The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.		-0.3
It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.	On disait qu'il serait bon, et Wenvorth aimait passionnement la musique.	0.295161
Of course they must attend. ~~~ It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.	Elle desirait causer quelques instants avec lui, et se sentait le courage de lui adresser la parole.	-0.0194118
If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred.		-0.3
Elizabeth had turned from him, Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.	Ni lady Russel, ni Elisabeth n'avaient voulu le reconnaitre, et elle pensait qu'elle lui devait une reparation.	0.196875
She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.	Elle avait promis a Mme Shmith de passer la soiree avec elle.	-0.110407
Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.	Elle y entra un instant, lui promettant une plus longue visite le lendemain.	0.156818
"By all means," said she; "only tell me all about it, when you do come.	<< Certainement, dit Mme Shmith ; seulement vous me raconterez tout.	0.544828
Who is your party?"	Ou allez-vous ?	0.235714
Anne named them all.	>> Anna le lui dit, et ne recut pas de reponse.	-0.0333333
Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, "Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you."	Mais quand elle sortit, Mme Shmith lui dit d'un air moitie serieux, moitie malin : << Ne manquez pas de venir demain.	-0.108247
Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.	Quelque chose me dit que bientot vous ne viendrez plus.	-0.102128
Chapter 20 Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room.	>> CHAPITRE XX Sir Walter, ses deux filles et Mme Clay arriverent les premiers au concert, et, en attendant lady Dalrymph, s'assirent aupres du feu ; a peine y etaient-ils que le capitaine Wenvorth entra.	0.440351
But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.	Anna se trouvait pres de la porte, elle s'avanca vers lui et lui dit un bonsoir gracieux.	0.259459
Anne was the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.	Il se mit a causer avec elle, malgre les regards du pere et de la soeur.	0.430603
He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle "How do you do?" ~~~ brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.	Anna ne les voyait pas, mais entendait leurs chuchotements, et quand elle vit Wenvorth saluer de loin, elle comprit que Sir Walter avait bien voulu lui faire un leger salut.	-0.0254032
Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done.	Apres avoir parle de Bath et du concert, il lui dit en souriant et en rougissant un peu : << Je vous ai a peine vue depuis la journee passee a Lyme.	0.382203
While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear.	Je crains que vous n'ayez souffert de cette emotion, d'autant plus que vous l'avez renfermee.	0.28
She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.		-0.3
This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than nothing, and her spirits improved.		-0.3
After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert, their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little smile, a little glow, he said-- "I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.		-0.3
I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you at the time."		-0.3
She assured him that she had not.		-0.3
"It was a frightful hour," said he, "a frightful day!"	>> Elle l'assura qu'elle n'avait pas souffert.	0.263415
and he passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added, "The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.	<< Ce fut un terrible moment, >> dit-il, et il passa sa main sur ses yeux, comme si ce souvenir etait encore trop penible, mais bientot il ajouta en souriant : << Cette journee cependant a eu des consequences qui ne sont pas terribles.	0.465803
When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery."	Quand vous eutes la presence d'esprit de suggerer que c'etait a Benwick de trouver un medecin, vous ne pensiez guere que c'etait lui qui avait le plus d'interet a la guerison de Louisa.	0.535485
"Certainly I could have none.	-- Cela est certain.	0.166667
But it appears--I should hope it would be a very happy match.	Mais j'espere que ce sera un heureux mariage.	0.207692
There are on both sides good principles and good temper."	Ils ont tous deux de bons principes et un bon caractere.	0.287234
"Yes," said he, looking not exactly forward; "but there, I think, ends the resemblance.	-- Oui, dit-il, mais ici finit la ressemblance.	0.0512195
With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it.	Je les souhaite heureux de toute mon ame.	-0.0257143
They have no difficulties to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.	Ils n'auront ni lutte a soutenir, ni caprices, ni opposition, ni retards.	0.473626
The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly, only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort. ~~~ All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps--" He stopped.	Tout cela est beaucoup plus que... >> Il s'arreta : un souvenir soudain lui donna un peu de cette emotion qui faisait rougir Anna et lui faisait tenir les yeux baisses, il affermit sa voix, et continua : << J'avoue que je trouve entre eux une difference d'esprit trop grande.	-0.0160976
A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground.		-0.3
After clearing his throat, however, he proceeded thus-- "I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity, and in a point no less essential than mind.		-0.3
I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more.	Louisa est une aimable jeune fille, douce et assez intelligente, mais Benwick est quelque chose de plus.	0.552434
He is a clever man, a reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise.	C'est un homme instruit, un esprit delicat, et j'avoue que je suis etonne de son choix.	0.205479
Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it would have been another thing.	S'il avait ete prefere par elle et l'eut aimee par reconnaissance, c'est different ; mais il semble, au contraire, qu'il y ait eu chez lui un attachement soudain, et cela me surprend.	0.211017
But I have no reason to suppose it so.	Un homme comme lui !	0.0529412
It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.		-0.3
A man like him, in his situation!	un coeur presque brise !	0.2
with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!	Fanny Harville etait une creature superieure, et il l'aimait sincerement.	0.1125
Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was indeed attachment.	Un homme ne doit pas guerir, et ne guerit pas d'un tel amour pour une telle femme.	0.241791
A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman.	>> Anna eprouva en un moment mille sensations de plaisir et de confusion.	0.284746
He ought not; he does not."	Elle sentait son coeur battre plus vite.	0.143478
Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered, or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who, in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a moment.		-0.3
It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say-- "You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"	Il lui fut impossible de continuer ce sujet, mais, sentant la necessite de parler, elle prit un detour : << Etes-vous reste longtemps a Lyme ?	0.318832
"About a fortnight.	-- Environ quinze jours.	0.233333
I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well was quite ascertained.	Je ne pouvais pas m'eloigner tant que Louisa etait en danger.	0.265385
I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace.	J'avais eu une part trop grande dans ce malheur pour etre tranquille.	0.283929
It had been my doing, solely mine.	C'etait ma faute.	0.05625
She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.	Elle n'aurait pas ete si obstinee, si j'avais ete moins faible.	0.255319
The country round Lyme is very fine. ~~~ I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the more I found to admire."	J'ai explore les environs de Lyme, qui sont tres beaux ; et plus je voyais, plus je trouvais a admirer.	0.0297286
"I should very much like to see Lyme again," said Anne.		-0.3
"Indeed! ~~~ I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.	-- J'aimerais bien a revoir Lyme, dit Anna.	-0.00765766
The horror and distress you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!		-0.3
I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust."	-- Vraiment, je ne l'aurais pas cru.	-0.0870968
"The last hours were certainly very painful," replied Anne; "but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.		-0.3
One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at Lyme.	La scene de desolation a laquelle vous avez ete melee, la fatigue et la contention d'esprit que vous avez eprouvees auraient du vous degouter de Lyme.	0.515079
We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.	-- Les dernieres heures furent certainement penibles, repondit Anna, mais le souvenir d'un chagrin passe devient un plaisir, et ce n'est pas le seul souvenir que Lyme m'ait laisse.	0.141
So much novelty and beauty!	Nous y avons eu beaucoup de plaisir.	0.2125
I have travelled so little, that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in short" (with a faint blush at some recollections), "altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable."		-0.3
As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting.		-0.3
"Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple," was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her.		-0.3
Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant, advanced into the room.		-0.3
The others joined them, and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.	J'ai voyage si peu que tout endroit nouveau m'interesse.	0.0979592
She was divided from Captain Wentworth.	Il y a de reelles beautes a Lyme.	0.211111
Their interesting, almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!	Il ne me reste que des impressions agreables, >> dit-elle en rougissant un peu.	-0.00895522
She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.		-0.3
She was in good humour with all.	A ce moment la porte s'ouvrit.	0.288462
She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.	<< Lady Dalrymph, >> s'ecria-t-on joyeusement, et Sir Walter et sa fille s'avancerent avec empressement au-devant d'elle.	0.29434
The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw that he was gone.	Anna fut separee du capitaine Wenvorth, mais elle en avait appris en dix minutes plus qu'elle n'eut ose esperer.	0.202105
She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room.	Elle cacha son agitation et sa joie sous les banalites de la conversation.	0.20625
He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment's regret.	Elle se sentait polie et bonne, et disposee a plaindre tous ceux qui n'etaient pas aussi heureux qu'elle.	0.326471
But "they should meet again.	On entra dans la salle du concert.	0.252
He would look for her, he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.	Elisabeth, au bras de miss Carteret, regardait le large dos de la douairiere vicomtesse Dalrymph et semblait au comble du bonheur. ~~~ Et Anna ?...	-0.00857143
She was in need of a little interval for recollection."	Mais ce serait insulter a son bonheur que de le comparer a celui de sa soeur.	0.4706
Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people as they could.		-0.3
Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.	L'un prenait sa source dans une vanite egoiste, l'autre dans un noble attachement.	0.245
Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other all generous attachment.		-0.3
Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.	Anna ne voyait rien autour d'elle.	0.05
Her happiness was from within.	Son bonheur etait en elle-meme.	0.288889
Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed; but she knew nothing about it.	Ses yeux brillaient, ses joues brulaient, mais elle n'en savait rien.	0.29
She was thinking only of the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty range over it.	Elle ne pensait qu'a cette derniere demi-heure.	-0.0714286
His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light.	Les expressions du capitaine, le sujet qu'il avait choisi, et plus encore son air et son regard, ne pouvaient laisser a Anna aucun doute.	0.268269
His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.	Son etonnement touchant Benwick, ses idees sur une premiere affection, les phrases qu'il n'avait pu finir, ses yeux qui se detournaient : tout disait a Anna que ce coeur lui revenait enfin ; que la colere et le ressentiment n'existaient plus, et qu'ils etaient remplaces par l'ancienne tendresse.	0.228049
Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past. ~~~ She could not contemplate the change as implying less.	Oui, il l'aimait ; ces pensees et les images qu'elles suggeraient l'absorbaient entierement.	-0.0111111
He must love her. ~~~ These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even trying to discern him.	Quand chacun fut assis a sa place, elle chercha des yeux Wenvorth, mais elle ne le vit pas, et le concert commenca.	-0.0879405
When their places were determined on, and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.		-0.3
The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well, with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.	M. Elliot s'etait arrange de facon a etre place pres d'Anna.	0.0529412
Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.	Miss Elliot, assise entre ses deux cousines et l'objet des attentions du colonel Wallis, etait tres satisfaite.	0.617708
Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening; it was just occupation enough: she had feelings for the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least during the first act.	Anna etait dans une disposition d'esprit a jouir de la musique ; pendant l'entr'acte elle expliquait a M. Elliot les paroles d'une chanson italienne.	0.256535
Towards the close of it, in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot.	<< Voici a peu pres le sens, dit-elle, car une chanson d'amour ne se peut guere traduire, et je ne suis pas tres savante.	0.296939
They had a concert bill between them. ~~~ "This," said she, "is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand the language. ~~~ I am a very poor Italian scholar."	-- Oui, je vois que vous ne savez rien, vous vous bornez a traduire fidelement, elegamment ces inversions et ces obscurites de la langue italienne.	-0.158871
"Yes, yes, I see you are. ~~~ I see you know nothing of the matter.	Ne parlez plus de votre ignorance, en voici une preuve complete.	-0.00566038
You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear, comprehensible, elegant English.	-- J'accepte vos eloges comme une bienveillante politesse, mais je ne voudrais pas subir un examen serieux.	0.127174
You need not say anything more of your ignorance. ~~~ Here is complete proof."	-- Je n'ai pas frequente Camben-Place si longtemps sans apprecier miss Anna Elliot.	-0.0161538
"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient."	Elle est trop modeste pour que le monde connaisse la moitie de ses perfections, et chez toute autre femme cette modestie ne serait pas naturelle.	0.159036
"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long," replied he, "without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman."		-0.3
"For shame! ~~~ for shame!	-- De grace, arretez : c'est trop de flatterie.	-0.122727
this is too much flattery.	Que va-t-on jouer maintenant ?	0.247826
I forget what we are to have next," turning to the bill.	dit-elle en regardant le programme.	0.16875
"Perhaps," said Mr Elliot, speaking low, "I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of."	-- Je vous connais peut-etre, dit M. Elliot en baissant la voix, depuis plus longtemps que vous ne pensez.	0.262921
"Indeed!	-- Vraiment !	0.2
How so?	comment cela se peut-il ?	-0.342857
You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family."		-0.3
"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.	Vous ne pouvez me connaitre que depuis mon arrivee a Bath.	0.5
I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately.	-- Je vous connaissais par oui-dire, longtemps avant.	0.280851
I have been acquainted with you by character many years.	On vous a depeinte a moi.	-0.0857143
Your person, your disposition, accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."	Votre personne, vos gouts, vos talents, tout est present a mon esprit.	0.455769
Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.	>> M. Elliot ne se trompait pas en esperant eveiller l'interet d'Anna.	0.503497
No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.		-0.3
To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.	On eprouve un charme mysterieux et irresistible a etre connue depuis longtemps sans le savoir.	0.402315
She wondered, and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.	Elle le questionna, mais en vain.	0.542365
He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell.	Il etait ravi qu'on l'interrogeat, mais il ne voulait rien dire.	0.216279
"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.	<< Non, non, plus tard peut-etre, mais pas maintenant.	0.264286
He would mention no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.	>> Anna se dit que ce ne pouvait etre que M. Wenvorth, le frere du capitaine, qui avait parle d'elle.	0.222727
He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the warmest curiosity to know her."	<< Le nom d'Anna Elliot m'interesse depuis longtemps, ajouta-t-il, et, si j'osais, j'exprimerais le desir qu'elle n'en change jamais.	0.380172
Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's brother.		-0.3
He might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she had not courage to ask the question.		-0.3
"The name of Anne Elliot," said he, "has long had an interesting sound to me.	>> Tout a coup une autre voix attira son attention.	0.153488
Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change."		-0.3
Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.		-0.3
Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.	Son pere parlait a lady Dalrymph.	0.196552
"A well-looking man," said Sir Walter, "a very well-looking man."		-0.3
"A very fine young man indeed!"	<< C'est un tres bel homme, disait-il.	0.233333
said Lady Dalrymple.	-- Oui, dit lady Dalrymph.	0.236842
"More air than one often sees in Bath. ~~~ Irish, I dare say."	Il a plus grand air que les gens qu'on voit generalement a Bath.	0.234896
"No, I just know his name.	N'est-il pas Irlandais ?	0.3
A bowing acquaintance.		-0.3
Wentworth; Captain Wentworth of the navy.	-- Son nom est Wenvorth, capitaine de marine.	0.283784
His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch."	Sa soeur est la femme de M. Croft, mon locataire a Kellynch, dans le comte de Somerset.	0.513122
Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance.		-0.3
As her eyes fell on him, his seemed to be withdrawn from her.		-0.3
It had that appearance. ~~~ It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe, he did not look again: but the performance was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward. ~~~ When she could give another glance, he had moved away.		-0.3
He could not have come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in: but she would rather have caught his eye.	>> Anna, ayant suivi la direction des regards de son pere, apercut le capitaine, debout au milieu d'un groupe.	0.270968
Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her. ~~~ She had no longer any inclination to talk to him.	Quand leurs yeux se rencontrerent, il lui sembla qu'il detournait les siens.	-0.0272727
She wished him not so near her. ~~~ The first act was over.	Mais la musique recommenca, et elle fut forcee d'y donner son attention.	-0.0478723
Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did decide on going in quest of tea.		-0.3
Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move.	Quand elle regarda de nouveau, il etait parti.	0.2925
She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not mean, whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.		-0.3
She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him. ~~~ He did not come however.	La premiere partie du concert etant finie, quelques personnes proposerent d'aller prendre du the.	-0.0054878
Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance, but he never came.	Anna resta assise a cote de lady Russel, et fut debarrassee de M. Elliot.	0.50445
The anxious interval wore away unproductively. ~~~ The others returned, the room filled again, benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.	Elle etait decidee a parler a Wenvorth si le hasard l'amenait aupres d'elle, malgre la presence de lady Russel, qui l'avait certainement apercu.	-0.097561
To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.	La salle se remplit de nouveau, et Anna eut a entendre une longue heure de musique.	0.201923
She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without the interchange of one friendly look.		-0.3
In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which was favourable for her.	Elle etait fort agitee, et ne pouvait etre tranquille tant qu'elle n'aurait pas echange avec lui un regard ami.	0.264286
Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals, and a little scheming of her own, Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much more within reach of a passer-by.		-0.3
She could not do so, without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but still she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed.		-0.3
Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth was again in sight.	Elle se placa a dessein a l'extremite d'une banquette, avec une place vide aupres d'elle.	0.471711
She saw him not far off. ~~~ He saw her too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her.	Bientot Wenvorth s'approcha, mais avec hesitation ; il avait un air grave ; le changement etait frappant.	-0.0283333
She felt that something must be the matter. ~~~ The change was indubitable.	Elle pensa que son pere ou lady Russel l'avait peut-etre blesse...	-0.0157895
The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great. ~~~ Why was it?	Il parla du concert, dit qu'il esperait de meilleur chant et qu'il ne serait pas fache d'en voir la fin.	-0.00176471
She thought of her father, of Lady Russell.		-0.3
Could there have been any unpleasant glances? ~~~ He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.		-0.3
Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.	Mais elle defendit si bien les chanteurs, tout en tenant compte, d'une maniere charmante, de l'opinion du capitaine qu'il repondit par un sourire et que sa figure s'eclaircit.	0.281879
They talked for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.	Alors il parut plus a l'aise, et jeta meme un regard sur le banc pour y prendre place a cote d'Anna.	0.353535
It came from Mr Elliot. ~~~ He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain Italian again.	A ce moment elle se sentit toucher l'epaule ; c'etait M. Elliot qui la priait de vouloir bien expliquer encore l'italien.	-0.0321429
Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung.	Miss Carteret desirait comprendre ce qu'on allait chanter.	0.880128
Anne could not refuse; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.	Anna ne put refuser, mais jamais elle n'avait fait a la politesse un plus grand sacrifice.	0.456734
A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.		-0.3
"He must wish her good night; he was going; he should get home as fast as he could."	Quand elle se retourna vers le capitaine, il lui dit adieu precipitamment.	0.28125
"Is not this song worth staying for?"	<< Cette chanson ne merite-t-elle pas qu'on reste ?	0.1875
said Anne, suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.	dit Anna soudainement poussee a encourager Wenvorth.	0.12766
"No!" ~~~ he replied impressively, "there is nothing worth my staying for;" and he was gone directly.	-- Non, dit-il d'un ton singulier. ~~~ Rien ici n'est digne de me retenir.	-0.191803
Jealousy of Mr Elliot!	>> Et il partit.	0.171429
It was the only intelligible motive.	Il etait donc jaloux de M. Elliot.	0.268966
Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!	C'etait la le seul motif plausible.	0.222581
Could she have believed it a week ago; three hours ago!	Aurait-elle pu le croire trois heures auparavant !	0.286364
For a moment the gratification was exquisite.	Ce fut un moment de joie exquise.	0.546429
But, alas!	Mais, helas !	0.24
there were very different thoughts to succeed.	combien differentes furent les pensees qui suivirent !	0.24878
How was such jealousy to be quieted?	Comment apaiser cette jalousie ?	0.27931
How was the truth to reach him?		-0.3
How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he ever learn of her real sentiments?	Comment pourrait-il jamais connaitre les vrais sentiments d'Anna ?	0.101695
It was misery to think of Mr Elliot's attentions. ~~~ Their evil was incalculable.	Les attentions de M. Elliot la firent souffrir horriblement, ce soir-la.	-0.0142857
Chapter 21 Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object.		-0.3
She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.	CHAPITRE XXI Le lendemain Anna se rappela avec plaisir sa promesse a Mme Shmith.	0.39
In spite of the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhaps compassion.	Elle serait absente quand M. Elliot viendrait, car l'eviter etait maintenant son seul desir.	0.285
She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.		-0.3
It was altogether very extraordinary; flattering, but painful. ~~~ There was much to regret.	Elle eprouvait cependant pour lui une grande bienveillance ; elle lui devait de la reconnaissance et de l'estime.	-0.0341772
How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case, was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be his for ever.		-0.3
Their union, she believed, could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.	Mais Wenvorth existait seul pour elle, soit qu'elle dut etre unie a lui, soit qu'elle en fut separee pour toujours.	0.249398
Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.		-0.3
It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.	Jamais peut-etre les rues de Bath n'avaient ete traversees par de pareils reves d'amour.	0.206897
She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her, though it had been an appointment.	Ce matin-la son amie sembla particulierement reconnaissante, car elle comptait a peine sur sa visite.	0.2625
An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it.		-0.3
All that she could tell she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter, rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company.		-0.3
Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith.	Elle demanda des details, et Anna se fit un plaisir de lui raconter la soiree.	0.272308
"The little Durands were there, I conclude," said she, "with their mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.		-0.3
They never miss a concert."	Ses traits etaient animes par le souvenir.	0.1375
"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room."	Mais ce n'etait pas assez pour la curieuse Mme Shmith, qui demanda des details particuliers sur les personnes.	0.172727
"The Ibbotsons, were they there? ~~~ and the two new beauties, with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them."	<< Les petites Durand etaient-elles la, la bouche ouverte pour gober la musique, comme des moineaux qui demandent la becquee.	-0.00582524
"I do not know. ~~~ I do not think they were."	Elles ne manquent jamais un concert.	-0.01875
"Old Lady Mary Maclean?		-0.3
I need not ask after her.	-- Je ne les ai pas vues.	0.285
She never misses, I know; and you must have seen her.	Mais j'ai entendu dire qu'elles etaient dans la salle.	0.279545
She must have been in your own circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur, round the orchestra, of course."		-0.3
"No, that was what I dreaded.	-- Et la vieille lady Maclean ?	0.288
It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect.	Elle devait etre dans votre voisinage, car vous etiez certainement aux places d'honneur, pres de l'orchestre, avec lady Dalrymph ?	-0.0857143
But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little."	-- Non, c'est ce que je craignais ; mais heureusement lady Dalrymph cherche toujours a etre le plus loin possible, et il parait que je n'ai pas vu grand'chose.	0.240909
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
you saw enough for your own amusement.		-0.3
I can understand.		-0.3
There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this you had.	assez pour votre amusement, il me semble, et puis vous aviez mieux a faire.	0.47619
You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing beyond."	Je vois dans vos yeux que vous avez eu une soiree agreable.	0.238776
"But I ought to have looked about me more," said Anne, conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that the object only had been deficient.		-0.3
"No, no; you were better employed.	Vous causiez dans les entr'actes ?	0.3
You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening.		-0.3
I see it in your eye.	>> Anna sourit.	0.235714
I perfectly see how the hours passed: that you had always something agreeable to listen to.		-0.3
In the intervals of the concert it was conversation."		-0.3
Anne half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eye?"	<< Que voyez-vous dans mes yeux ?	0.117857
"Yes, I do. ~~~ Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together."	-- Votre visage me dit que vous etiez hier avec la personne que vous trouvez la plus aimable entre toutes, et qui vous interesse plus que l'univers entier.	-0.0273456
A blush overspread Anne's cheeks. ~~~ She could say nothing.	>> Une rougeur s'etendit sur les joues d'Anna ; elle ne put repondre.	-0.0205882
"And such being the case," continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, "I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning.	<< Et cela etant, continua Mme Shmith apres un silence, vous saurez combien j'apprecie votre visite.	0.143023
It is really very good of you to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time."	C'est vraiment bien bon de votre part, vous qui avez tant d'autres invitations.	0.180882
Anne heard nothing of this. ~~~ She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.	>> La penetration de Mme Shmith saisit Anna d'etonnement et de confusion ; elle ne pouvait imaginer comment elle savait quelque chose sur Wenvorth.	0.0444
After another short silence-- "Pray," said Mrs Smith, "is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me? ~~~ Does he know that I am in Bath?"	<< Dites-moi, je vous prie, continua Mme Shmith ; M. Elliot sait-il que je suis a Bath, et que vous me connaissez ?	0.0731061
"Mr Elliot!"	-- M. Elliot !	0.3
repeated Anne, looking up surprised. ~~~ A moment's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under.	reprit Anna surprise, mais elle se reprit aussitot, et ajouta d'un air indifferent : Vous le connaissez ?	0
She caught it instantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added, more composedly, "Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?"		-0.3
"I have been a good deal acquainted with him," replied Mrs Smith, gravely, "but it seems worn out now.	-- Je l'ai connu beaucoup autrefois, dit madame Shmith gravement ; mais c'est fini maintenant.	0.285185
It is a great while since we met."	-- Vous ne m'en avez jamais rien dit !	0.267857
"I was not at all aware of this. ~~~ You never mentioned it before.	Si je l'avais su, j'aurais eu le plaisir de lui parler de vous.	-0.00576923
Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you."		-0.3
"To confess the truth," said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual air of cheerfulness, "that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.	-- Pour dire la verite, dit Mme Shmith reprenant son air gai, c'est exactement le plaisir que je vous prie de me faire.	0.394388
I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.		-0.3
I want your interest with him. ~~~ He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness, my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is done."	M. Elliot peut m'etre tres utile, et si vous avez la bonte, chere miss Elliot, de prendre ma cause en main, elle sera gagnee.	0.0323301
"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you," replied Anne; "but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.	-- J'en serais extremement heureuse : j'espere que vous ne doutez pas de mon desir de vous etre utile, repondit Anna, mais vous me supposez une plus grande influence que je n'en ai.	0.344471
I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion. ~~~ You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation.	Je suis parente de M. Elliot, a ce titre seulement n'hesitez pas a m'employer.	0.0673846
If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not hesitate to employ me."		-0.3
Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said-- "I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.	>> Mme Shmith lui jeta un regard penetrant, puis, souriant, elle lui dit : << J'ai ete un peu trop vite a ce que je vois.	0.387887
I ought to have waited for official information.	Pardonnez-le-moi, j'aurais du attendre une declaration officielle.	0.164286
But now, my dear Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.	Mais, chere miss Elliot, dites-moi, comme a une vieille amie, quand je pourrai parler.	0.682857
Next week? ~~~ To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune."	Me sera-t-il permis, la semaine prochaine, de penser, que tout est decide, et de batir mes projets egoistes sur le bonheur de M. Elliot ?	-0.00131579
"No," replied Anne, "nor next week, nor next, nor next.	-- Non, repondit Anna ; ni la semaine prochaine, ni les suivantes.	0.242553
I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.	Rien de ce que vous pensez ne se fera.	-0.0580645
I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.	Je ne dois pas epouser M. Elliot.	0.675
I should like to know why you imagine I am?"		-0.3
Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her head, and exclaimed-- "Now, how I do wish I understood you!		-0.3
How I do wish I knew what you were at!	Qui vous le fait croire ?	0.171429
I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when the right moment occurs.	>> Mme Shmith la regarda avec attention, sourit, secoua la tete et dit : << Je crois que vous ne serez pas cruelle quand le moment sera arrive.	0.249199
Till it does come, you know, we women never mean to have anybody.	Jusque-la, nous autres femmes, nous ne voulons rien avouer.	0.288462
It is a thing of course among us, that every man is refused, till he offers.	Tout homme qui ne nous a pas encore demandees est cense refuse.	0.479826
But why should you be cruel?		-0.3
Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend.		-0.3
Where can you look for a more suitable match?	Laissez-moi plaider pour mon ancien ami.	0.283333
Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?	Ou trouverez-vous un mari plus gentleman, un homme plus aimable ?	0.276923
Let me recommend Mr Elliot.	Laissez-moi recommander M. Elliot.	0.8
I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?"	Je suis sure que le colonel Wallis ne vous a dit de lui que du bien ; et qui peut le mieux connaitre que le colonel Wallis ?	0.414306
"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above half a year.	-- Ma chere madame Shmith, il n'y a pas un an que Mme Elliot est morte.	0.439628
He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one."	Votre supposition n'est pas admissible.	0.141667
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
if these are your only objections," cried Mrs Smith, archly, "Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.		-0.3
Do not forget me when you are married, that's all.	si ce sont la vos seules objections !	0.193548
Let him know me to be a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.	dit Mme Shmith d'un air malin, M. Elliot est sauve, et je ne m'inquiete plus de lui.	-0.23913
Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.	Ne m'oubliez pas quand vous serez mariee : voila tout.	0.255
Of course, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.	Dites-lui que je suis votre amie, et il m'obligera plus facilement qu'aujourd'hui.	0.12
Well, my dear Miss Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.	J'espere, chere miss Elliot, que vous serez tres heureuse.	0.576471
Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman.	M. Elliot a assez de bon sens pour apprecier la valeur d'une femme telle que vous.	0.653538
Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been.	Votre bonheur ne fera pas naufrage comme le mien.	0.285714
You are safe in all worldly matters, and safe in his character.	Vous avez la fortune, et vous connaissez le caractere de votre fiance.	0.260377
He will not be led astray; he will not be misled by others to his ruin."	D'autres ne l'entraineront pas a sa ruine.	0.12973
"No," said Anne, "I can readily believe all that of my cousin.	-- Oui, dit Anna, je peux croire tout le bien possible de mon cousin.	0.501923
He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous impressions. ~~~ I consider him with great respect.	Son caractere parait ferme et decide, et j'ai pour lui un grand respect.	0.0592857
I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.		-0.3
But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be known intimately soon.		-0.3
Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?	Mais je ne le connais pas depuis longtemps, et ce n'est pas un homme qu'on puisse connaitre vite.	0.271622
Surely this must be calm enough.	Ne comprenez-vous pas qu'il ne m'est rien ?	0.203571
And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.	S'il demandait ma main, je refuserais.	0.28125
Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.	Je vous assure que M. Elliot n'etait pour rien dans le plaisir que j'ai eu hier soir.	0.158571
I assure you I shall not. ~~~ I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford: not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--" She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much; but less would hardly have been sufficient.	Ce n'est pas M. Elliot qui... >> Elle s'arreta, et rougit fortement, regrettant d'en avoir tant dit.	-0.191961
Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception of there being a somebody else.	Puis, impatiente d'echapper a de nouvelles remarques, elle voulut savoir pourquoi Mme Shmith s'etait imagine qu'elle epouserait M. Elliot.	0.400962
As it was, she instantly submitted, and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.		-0.3
"Do tell me how it first came into your head."	<< D'abord, pour vous avoir vus souvent ensemble.	0.260526
"It first came into my head," replied Mrs Smith, "upon finding how much you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way.		-0.3
But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago." ~~~ "And has it indeed been spoken of?"	J'ai pense, comme tout le monde, que vos parents et vos amis desiraient cette union.	-0.00211268
"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday?" ~~~ "No.	Mais c'est depuis deux jours seulement que j'en ai entendu parler.	-0.0289474
Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?		-0.3
I observed no one in particular."	-- Vraiment, on en a parle !	0.221739
"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.	-- Avez-vous regarde la femme qui vous a introduite hier soir ?	0.179826
She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.	C'etait la garde, Mme Rock, qui, par parenthese, etait tres curieuse de vous voir et tres contente de se trouver la.	0.283696
She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.		-0.3
She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history."		-0.3
"The whole history," repeated Anne, laughing.	C'est elle qui m'a dit que vous epousiez M. Elliot.	0.285366
"She could not make a very long history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news."	-- Elle n'a pu dire grand'chose sur des bruits qui n'ont aucun fondement, >> dit Anna en riant.	0.296203
Mrs Smith said nothing.	Mme Shmith ne repondit pas.	0.257143
"But," continued Anne, presently, "though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could.		-0.3
Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?	<< Dois-je dire a M. Elliot que vous etes a Bath ?	0.257143
Shall I take any message?"	-- Non, certainement.	0.255
"No, I thank you: no, certainly not.		-0.3
In the warmth of the moment, and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.		-0.3
No, I thank you, I have nothing to trouble you with."	Je vous remercie ; ne vous occupez pas de moi.	0.252632
"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?"	-- Vous disiez avoir connu M. Elliot pendant longtemps ?	0.572727
"I did."	-- Oui.	0.257143
"Not before he was married, I suppose?"	-- Pas avant son mariage, sans doute ?	0.28125
"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first."	-- Il n'etait pas marie quand je l'ai connu.	0.275676
"And--were you much acquainted?"	-- Et vous etiez tres liee avec lui ?	0.3
"Intimately."	-- Intimement.	0.3
"Indeed!	-- Vraiment !	0.2
Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.		-0.3
I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.	alors dites-moi ce qu'il etait a cette epoque : je suis curieuse de le savoir.	0.451293
Was he at all such as he appears now?"	Etait-il tel qu'aujourd'hui ?	0.255556
"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years," was Mrs Smith's answer, given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.	-- Je ne l'ai pas vu depuis trois ans, >> repondit Mme Shmith d'une voix si grave, que continuer ce sujet devenait impossible.	0.0942857
They were both silent: Mrs Smith very thoughtful.	La curiosite d'Anna en fut accrue.	0.17
At last-- "I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot," she cried, in her natural tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.	Elles resterent toutes deux silencieuses ; enfin Mme Shmith dit : << Je vous demande pardon, chere miss Elliot, mais j'etais incertaine sur ce que je devais faire, et je me decide a vous laisser connaitre le vrai caractere de M. Elliot.	0.3235
I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.	Je crois maintenant que vous n'avez pas l'intention de l'accepter.	0.289286
There were many things to be taken into the account. ~~~ One hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.	Mais on ne sait ce qui peut arriver ; vous pourriez un jour ou l'autre penser differemment.	-0.0309524
Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may be nothing durable beneath.		-0.3
However, I have determined; I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's real character.		-0.3
Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may happen.		-0.3
You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards him.		-0.3
Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced. ~~~ Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character. ~~~ He has no feeling for others.	Ecoutez la verite : << M. Elliot est un homme sans coeur et sans conscience ; un etre prudent, ruse et froid, qui ne pense qu'a lui, qui, pour son bien-etre ou son interet, commettrait une cruaute, une trahison, s'il n'y trouvait aucun risque.	-0.087728
Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.	Il est capable d'abandonner ceux qu'il a entraines a la ruine sans le moindre remords.	0.184932
He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.	Il n'a aucun sentiment de justice ni de compassion.	1.07727
Oh!	Oh !	0.3
he is black at heart, hollow and black!"	il n'a pas de coeur, et son ame est noire.	0.3
Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and in a calmer manner, she added, "My expressions startle you. ~~~ You must allow for an injured, angry woman. ~~~ But I will try to command myself.	>> Elle s'arreta, voyant l'air surpris d'Anna, et ajouta d'un ton plus calme : << Mes expressions vous etonnent ; il faut faire la part d'une femme irritee et maltraitee, mais j'essayerai de me dominer.	-0.108182
I will not abuse him.	Je ne veux pas le decrier.	0.233333
I will only tell you what I have found him. ~~~ Facts shall speak.	Je vous dirai seulement ce qu'il a ete pour moi.	-0.0214286
He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself.	<< Il etait, avant mon mariage, l'ami intime de mon cher mari, qui le croyait aussi bon que lui-meme.	0.278571
The intimacy had been formed before our marriage.	M. Elliot me plut aussi beaucoup, et j'eus de lui une haute opinion.	0.202326
I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion of him.		-0.3
At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.		-0.3
We were principally in town, living in very good style.	A dix-neuf ans on ne raisonne pas beaucoup.	0.218919
He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman.	Nous vivions tres largement : il avait moins d'aisance que nous, et demeurait au temple ; c'est a peine s'il pouvait soutenir son rang.	0.343009
He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.	Mais notre maison etait la sienne ; il y etait le bienvenu ; on le regardait comme un frere.	0.288
My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I know that he often assisted him."	Mon pauvre Henri, qui avait l'esprit le plus fin et le plus genereux, aurait partage avec lui jusqu'a son dernier sou, et je sais qu'il est venu souvent a son aide.	0.242222
"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life," said Anne, "which has always excited my particular curiosity.		-0.3
It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister.	-- Ce doit etre alors, dit Anna, qu'il connut mon pere et ma soeur.	0.229091
I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with present times.	Je n'ai jamais compris sa conduite avec eux ni son mariage ; cela ne s'accorde guere avec ce qu'il parait etre aujourd'hui.	0.0262136
It seemed to announce a different sort of man."	-- Je sais tout !	-0.257143
"I know it all, I know it all," cried Mrs Smith.	s'ecria Mme Shmith.	-0.05
"He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him, but I heard him speak of them for ever.	Il fut presente a Sir Walter avant que je le connusse, mais il en parlait souvent.	0.494118
I know he was invited and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.		-0.3
I can satisfy you, perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage, I knew all about it at the time.		-0.3
I was privy to all the fors and againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer any question you may wish to put."		-0.3
"Nay," said Anne, "I have no particular enquiry to make about her.	Je sais qu'il refusa les avances qu'on lui fit.	0.18
I have always understood they were not a happy couple.	Je sais aussi tout ce qui a rapport a son mariage.	0.536142
But I should like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did.	Sa femme etait d'une condition inferieure ; je l'ai connue pendant les deux dernieres annees de sa vie.	0.293103
My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him.	-- On m'a dit que ce ne fut pas un heureux mariage, dit Anna.	0.208163
Why did Mr Elliot draw back?" ~~~ "Mr Elliot," replied Mrs Smith, "at that period of his life, had one object in view: to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process than the law.	Mais j'aimerais a savoir pourquoi il repoussa les avances de mon pere.	-0.0446154
He was determined to make it by marriage. ~~~ He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.		-0.3
That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you. ~~~ He told me the whole story. ~~~ He had no concealments with me.	-- M. Elliot, continua Mme Shmith, avait alors le desir de faire rapidement fortune par un riche mariage.	-0.127143
It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father and sister.		-0.3
He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other."	Il n'avait aucun secret pour moi ; il me le dit, et me parlait souvent de votre pere et de votre soeur.	0.228358
"Perhaps," cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, "you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot?"	-- Peut-etre, dit Anna frappee d'une idee soudaine, lui avez-vous quelquefois parle de moi ?	0.284
"To be sure I did; very often. ~~~ I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot, and vouch for your being a very different creature from--" She checked herself just in time.	-- Tres souvent : je me vantais de connaitre ma chere Anna, et je disais que vous ne ressembliez guere a...... >> Elle s'arreta brusquement.	-0.0125
"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night," cried Anne.	<< Cela m'explique ce que m'a dit M. Elliot hier soir.	0.423333
"This explains it.	Je n'y comprenais rien.	0.229412
I found he had been used to hear of me. ~~~ I could not comprehend how.	Mais je vous ai interrompue : alors M. Elliot fit un mariage d'argent ?	-0.00803571
What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned!	et c'est la sans doute ce qui vous ouvrit les yeux sur son caractere ?	0.283333
How sure to be mistaken!	>> Ici Mme Shmith hesita : << Oh !	0.214286
But I beg your pardon; I have interrupted you.	ces choses sont trop communes pour frapper beaucoup.	0.246154
Mr Elliot married then completely for money?	J'etais tres jeune, gaie et insouciante.	0.275
The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his character."		-0.3
Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.	Je ne pensais qu'au plaisir.	0.24
"Oh! ~~~ those things are too common.	La maladie et le chagrin m'ont donne d'autres idees.	-0.0677419
When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought.	Mais alors je ne voyais rien de reprehensible dans ce que faisait M. Elliot.	0.201563
I was very young, and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.		-0.3
We lived for enjoyment. ~~~ I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing.	Chercher son bien avant tout me paraissait naturel.	-0.15
'To do the best for himself,' passed as a duty."	-- Mais sa femme n'etait-elle pas de basse condition ?	0.255
"But was not she a very low woman?"	-- Oui, c'etait la mon objection, mais il ne voulut rien entendre.	0.0206897
"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.	De l'argent, c'etait tout ce qu'il voulait.	0.260526
Money, money, was all that he wanted.	Le pere etait vitrier, le grand-pere boucher.	0.225
Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.	Mais elle etait jolie, elle avait eu de l'education, et ses cousines l'avaient conduite dans la societe.	0.234247
She was a fine woman, had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her birth.		-0.3
All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.	Le hasard lui fit rencontrer Elliot : elle l'aima. ~~~ Il s'assura seulement du chiffre de la fortune.	-0.00705882
Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.	Il n'attachait pas d'importance, comme aujourd'hui, a son rang.	0.3
His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt.	Kellynch devait lui revenir un jour ; mais en attendant il ne se souciait guere de l'honneur de la famille.	0.442857
I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject.	Je lui ai souvent entendu dire que si une baronnie s'achetait il vendrait la sienne pour mille francs, y compris les armoiries et la devise, le nom et la livree.	0.166917
It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof."	Mais ce serait mal de raconter tout ce qu'il disait sur ce sujet, et cependant je dois vous donner des preuves.	0.290217
"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none," cried Anne.		-0.3
"You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.	-- Je n'en ai pas besoin : ce que vous m'avez dit s'accorde bien avec tout ce que nous avons entendu dire.	0.260526
This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.		-0.3
I am more curious to know why he should be so different now."	Je suis curieuse de savoir pourquoi il est si different maintenant ?	0.482769
"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary; stay: I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet."	-- Pour ma propre satisfaction, restez, et soyez assez bonne pour aller prendre dans ma chambre une petite boite incrustee que vous trouverez sur la tablette du cabinet.	0.262889
Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.	>> Anna fit ce que son amie desirait, et la boite fut placee devant Mme Shmith.	0.285484
The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it as she unlocked it, said-- "This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.		-0.3
The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.	Elle soupira en l'ouvrant et dit : << Elle est pleine de lettres de M. Elliot a mon mari.	0.275
But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.		-0.3
Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy.		-0.3
I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it."	J'en cherche une ecrite avant mon mariage et qui a ete conservee par hasard.	0.237736
This was the letter, directed to "Charles Smith, Esq. ~~~ Tunbridge Wells," and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:-- "Dear Smith,--I have received yours.	La voici ; je ne l'ai pas brulee, parce qu'etant peu satisfaite de M. Elliot, j'ai voulu conserver les preuves de notre ancienne intimite : << Cher Shmith, j'ai recu votre lettre.	-0.0119565
Your kindness almost overpowers me.	Votre bonte m'accable.	0.142857
I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.	Je voudrais que les coeurs comme le votre fussent moins rares ; mais j'ai vecu vingt-trois ans dans le monde, et je n'ai rien vu de pareil.	0.3
At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in cash again.	Je n'ai pas besoin d'argent en ce moment.	0.0514286
Give me joy: I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.	Felicitez-moi : je suis debarrasse de Sir Walter et de sa fille.	0.666417
They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.	Ils sont retournes a Kellynch, et m'ont fait presque jurer de les visiter cet ete.	0.266304
The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.	Mais quand j'irai, ce sera accompagne d'un arpenteur, pour savoir le meilleur parti qu'on peut tirer de la propriete.	0.177465
If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion.	Le baronnet pourrait bien se remarier ; il est assez fou pour cela.	0.15
He is worse than last year." ~~~ "I wish I had any name but Elliot.	<< S'il le fait, il me laissera en paix, ce qui est une compensation pour l'heritage.	-0.0509434
I am sick of it. ~~~ The name of Walter I can drop, thank God!	<< Je voudrais avoir un autre nom que Elliot ; j'en suis ecoeure.	-0.01875
and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only yours truly,--Wm.		-0.3
Elliot." ~~~ Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said-- "The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.	Heureusement je puis quitter celui de Walter, et je souhaite que vous ne me le jetiez jamais a la face, voulant pour le reste de ma vie me dire << Votre devoue << William Elliot.	0.0916521
Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning. ~~~ But it shows you the man.	>> Anna ne put lire cette lettre sans rougir ; ce que voyant, dit Mme Shmith : << Les expressions sont assez insolentes.	-0.00309278
Mark his professions to my poor husband.	Elles vous peignent l'homme.	0.196154
Can any thing be stronger?"	Peut-on etre plus clair ?	0.272727
Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father.	>> Anna fut quelque temps a se remettre du trouble et de la mortification qu'elle avait eprouves.	0.430081
She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over, and say-- "Thank you. ~~~ This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you were saying.	Elle fut obligee de se dire avant de recouvrer le calme necessaire, que cette lecture etait la violation du secret d'une lettre, et qu'on ne devait juger personne sur un pareil temoignage.	-0.072267
But why be acquainted with us now?"	<< Je vous remercie, dit-elle.	0.266667
"I can explain this too," cried Mrs Smith, smiling.	Voici bien la preuve complete de ce que vous m'avez dit.	0.279545
"Can you really?" ~~~ "Yes.	Mais pourquoi se lier avec nous, a present ?	-0.0913043
I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I will shew him as he is now.	-- Vous allez le savoir : je vous ai montre ce qu'etait M. Elliot, il y a douze ans ; je vais vous le montrer tel qu'il est aujourd'hui.	0.256522
I cannot produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.	Je ne puis vous donner des preuves ecrites, mais un temoignage verbal authentique.	0.0760563
He is no hypocrite now.	Il desire reellement vous epouser.	0.135
He truly wants to marry you.	Ses intentions sont tres sinceres.	0.2125
His present attentions to your family are very sincere: quite from the heart.		-0.3
I will give you my authority: his friend Colonel Wallis."	Mon autorite en ceci est le colonel Wallis.	0.202703
"Colonel Wallis!		-0.3
you are acquainted with him?"	-- Vous le connaissez donc ?	0.275
"No. ~~~ It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.	-- Non, la chose ne me vient pas si directement, mais la source n'en est pas moins bonne.	0.0501802
The stream is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away.		-0.3
Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.		-0.3
She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.		-0.3
On Monday evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.	M. Elliot parle a coeur ouvert de ses projets de mariage au colonel Wallis, qui me parait un caractere sense, prudent et observateur.	0.371688
When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed."	Mais il a une jolie femme tres sotte, a qui il dit tout ce qu'il fait ; celle-ci repete tout a sa garde, qui me le redit.	0.394444
"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.	-- Ma chere Mme Shmith, votre autorite est en faute.	0.285714
This will not do. ~~~ Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.	Les idees que M. Elliot a sur moi n'expliquent aucunement ses efforts pour se reconcilier avec mon pere.	0.125508
That was all prior to my coming to Bath.	Ils etaient deja sur un pied d'intimite quand je suis arrivee a Bath.	0.372727
I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived." ~~~ "I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--" "Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such a line.	-- Oui, je sais cela, mais... Ecoutez-moi seulement : vous jugerez bientot s'il faut y croire, en ecoutant quelques particularites que vous pourrez immediatement contredire ou confirmer.	-0.00888158
Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly have much truth left."	Il vous avait vue et admiree avant d'aller a Bath sans vous connaitre, est-ce vrai ?	0.03
"Only give me a hearing.	-- Oui, je l'ai vu a Lyme.	0.8
You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.		-0.3
Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.		-0.3
He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without knowing it to be you.		-0.3
So says my historian, at least.		-0.3
Is this true? ~~~ Did he see you last summer or autumn, 'somewhere down in the west,' to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?" ~~~ "He certainly did. ~~~ So far it is very true.		-0.3
At Lyme.	-- Bien.	0.3
I happened to be at Lyme." ~~~ "Well," continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, "grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted.	Le premier point reconnu vrai, accordez quelque confiance a mon amie.	0.0075
He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.	Il vous vit a Lyme, et vous lui plutes tellement qu'il fut ravi de vous retrouver a Camben-Place, sous le nom de miss Anna Elliot.	0.342919
But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.	Des ce moment, ses visites eurent un double motif.	0.223256
If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me. ~~~ My account states, that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger."	Mon historien dit que l'amie de votre soeur est a Bath depuis le commencement de septembre ; que c'est une femme habile, insinuante ; une belle personne, pauvre et... qui doit desirer s'appeler lady Elliot ; et l'on se demande avec surprise pourquoi miss Elliot semble ne pas voir le danger.	0.0367133
Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she continued-- "This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail.		-0.3
Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy. ~~~ Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man.	>> Ici, Mme Shmith s'arreta un moment ; mais, Anna gardant le silence, elle continua : << Ceux qui connaissent la famille voyaient les choses ainsi, longtemps avant votre arrivee.	-0.0129139
Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to.	Le colonel Wallis, ami de M. Elliot, avait l'oeil sur votre pere et etudiait avec interet ce qui se passe ici ; il mit M. Elliot au courant des cancans.	0.215323
I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.	Celui-ci a completement change d'avis pour ce qui touche le rang et les relations ; et maintenant qu'il est riche, il s'est accoutume a etayer son bonheur sur sa baronnie future.	0.180471
He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.	Il ne peut supporter l'idee de ne pas etre Sir Walter.	0.543459
You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material.		-0.3
This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could.		-0.3
He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.	Vous pouvez deviner que les nouvelles apportees par son ami ne lui ont pas ete agreables.	0.276
Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.	Il a resolu de s'etablir a Bath et de se lier avec la famille, afin de s'assurer du danger et de circonvenir la dame, s'il etait necessaire, et le colonel a promis de l'aider.	0.16993
He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.	Le seul but de M. Elliot etait d'abord d'etudier Mme Clay et Sir Walter, quand votre arrivee y ajouta un autre motif.	0.371672
You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do."	Mais je n'ai pas besoin d'entrer dans des details, et vous pouvez vous souvenir de ce qui s'est passe depuis.	0.283516
"Yes," said Anne, "you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known, or could imagine.	-- Oui, dit Anna ; ce que vous me dites s'accorde avec ce que j'ai vu.	0.321113
There is always something offensive in the details of cunning. ~~~ The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.	La ruse a toujours quelque chose d'offensif ; et les manoeuvres de l'egoisme et de la duplicite sont revoltantes ; mais rien de ce que j'ai entendu ne me surprend, j'ai toujours suppose a sa conduite un motif cache.	-0.0200637
I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.	J'aimerais a connaitre sa pensee sur la probabilite de l'evenement qu'il redoute.	0.311051
I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.		-0.3
I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not."		-0.3
"Lessening, I understand," replied Mrs Smith.		-0.3
"He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence.	-- Il pense que Mme Clay sait qu'il voit son jeu, qu'elle le craint, et que sa presence l'empeche d'agir comme elle le voudrait.	0.405149
But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence.	Mais il partira un jour ou l'autre, et je ne vois pas comment il pourra etre jamais tranquille, tant qu'elle gardera son influence.	0.413679
Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.	Mme Wallis a une idee amusante, c'est de mettre dans votre contrat de mariage avec M. Elliot que votre pere n'epousera pas Mme Clay.	0.583636
A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.		-0.3
'Why, to be sure, ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'		-0.3
And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.		-0.3
She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?"		-0.3
"I am very glad to know all this," said Anne, after a little thoughtfulness.	Cela ne l'empechera pas, dit Mme Rock, d'en epouser une autre.	0.237736
"It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do. ~~~ My line of conduct will be more direct.	-- Je suis tres enchantee de savoir tout cela ; il me sera peut-etre plus penible de me trouver avec lui, mais je saurai mieux comment il faut agir.	0.00375
Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness."	M. Elliot est decidement un homme mondain et ruse qui n'a d'autres principes pour le guider que l'egoisme.	0.374561
But Mr Elliot was not done with. ~~~ Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice and compassion.		-0.3
She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.		-0.3
Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.	>> Mais Mme Shmith n'en avait pas fini avec M. Elliot, Il avait entraine son mari a sa ruine ; et Anna put se convaincre que M. Shmith avait un coeur aimant, un caractere facile et insouciant, et une intelligence tres mediocre ; que son ami le dominait et probablement le meprisait.	0.34727
From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him, led by him, and probably despised by him.		-0.3
Mr Elliot, raised by his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined. ~~~ The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.		-0.3
They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known.		-0.3
With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard, more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act, and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her, in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to without corresponding indignation.		-0.3
Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her.		-0.3
It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.	Devenu riche lui-meme, M. Elliot s'inquieta peu des embarras financiers de son ami, qui mourut juste a temps pour ne pas savoir sa ruine.	0.414783
She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.		-0.3
Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's usual state of mind.		-0.3
There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation.	Mais ils avaient assez connu la gene pour savoir qu'il ne fallait pas compter sur M. Elliot.	0.287838
She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this property, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively rich.		-0.3
But there was nobody to stir in it. ~~~ Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.	Cependant M. Shmith, par une confiance qui faisait plus d'honneur a son coeur qu'a son jugement, le nomma son executeur testamentaire ; il refusa, malgre les prieres de Mme Shmith, ne voulant pas s'engager dans des tracas inutiles.	-0.00983607
She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.		-0.3
This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.	Cette ingratitude equivalait pour Anna presque a un crime.	0.6
To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims, was hard to bear.	Elle ecouta cette histoire, comprenant que ce recit soulageait son amie, et s'etonnant seulement de son calme habituel.	0.163107
It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices with Mr Elliot.	Mme Shmith, en apprenant le mariage d'Anna, avait espere obtenir par son intermediaire un service de M. Elliot.	0.359524
She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings, as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow, when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.		-0.3
After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation.	C'etait pour recouvrer une propriete dans les Indes, dont les revenus etaient sous le sequestre ; elle etait forcee de renoncer a cet espoir.	0.206723
"She had seemed to recommend and praise him!" ~~~ "My dear," was Mrs Smith's reply, "there was nothing else to be done.	Anna ne put s'empecher de s'etonner que Mme Shmith eut d'abord parle si favorablement de M. Elliot.	-0.025
I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband.	<< Ma chere, lui repondit-elle, je regardais votre mariage comme certain, et je ne pouvais vous dire sur lui la verite ; mais mon coeur souffrait quand je vous parlais de bonheur.	0.357327
My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.	Cependant M. Elliot a des qualites, et, avec une femme comme vous, il ne fallait pas desesperer.	0.311111
He was very unkind to his first wife.		-0.3
They were wretched together. ~~~ But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.	Sa premiere femme fut malheureuse, mais elle etait ignorante et sotte, et il ne l'avait jamais aimee.	-0.00523256
I was willing to hope that you must fare better."	J'esperais qu'il en serait autrement pour vous.	0.292683
Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed.	>> Anna frissonna a la pensee de ce qu'elle aurait souffert.	0.0147059
It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!	Etait-il possible qu'elle eut consentie devenir lady Elliot ?	0.561111
And under such a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too late?	Et lequel des deux eut ete le plus miserable, quand le temps aurait tout fait connaitre, mais trop tard.	0.44755
It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference, which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.		-0.3
Chapter 22 Anne went home to think over all that she had heard. ~~~ In one point, her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot. ~~~ There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.	CHAPITRE XXII Une fois rentree chez elle, Anna se mit a penser a tout cela ; elle etait soulagee de pouvoir juger M. Elliot librement et de ne lui plus devoir aucune amitie.	-0.124561
He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed. ~~~ Pity for him was all over. ~~~ But this was the only point of relief.	Cependant elle sentait combien son pere serait froisse ; elle se preoccupait du chagrin et du desappointement de lady Russel, mais il fallait tout lui dire et attendre tranquillement la suite des evenements.	-0.110795
In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.	En arrivant chez elle, elle apprit que M. Elliot etait venu, mais qu'il reviendrait le soir.	0.230769
She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to avert any one of them.		-0.3
She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him. ~~~ She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed springing from it!	Je ne pensais pas a l'inviter, dit Elisabeth d'un air qu'elle affectait de rendre insouciant ; mais il desirait tellement venir, du moins a ce que dit Mme Clay.	0.0439714
Mrs Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done. ~~~ Could the knowledge have been extended through her family?	-- Oui, vraiment, dit celle-ci ; je n'ai jamais vu solliciter une invitation d'une maniere plus pressante.	-0.028022
But this was a vain idea. ~~~ She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.		-0.3
She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.		-0.3
"I had not the smallest intention of asking him," said Elizabeth, with affected carelessness, "but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at least."		-0.3
"Indeed, I do say it. ~~~ I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation.	J'etais reellement en peine pour lui, car votre soeur, impitoyable, semble decidee a etre cruelle.	-0.0295775
Poor man!	-- Oh !	0.15
I was really in pain for him; for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty."	s'ecria Elisabeth, je suis trop accoutumee a ces choses pour en etre touchee.	0.240909
"Oh!" ~~~ cried Elizabeth, "I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.	Mais quand j'ai vu combien il regrettait de ne pas rencontrer mon pere, j'ai cede.	-0.0413043
However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together.		-0.3
They appear to so much advantage in company with each other. ~~~ Each behaving so pleasantly.	Ils paraissent tous deux tellement a leur avantage quand ils sont ensemble.	-0.03
Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect." ~~~ "Quite delightful!"	Leurs facons sont si parfaites ; et M. Elliot est si respectueux !	0.0936937
cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her eyes towards Anne.	-- Cela est charmant, dit Mme Clay n'osant cependant regarder Anna.	0.294737
"Exactly like father and son!	Ils sont comme pere et fils.	0.275
Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?"	Chere miss Elliot, ne puis-je pas le dire ?	0.566667
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
I lay no embargo on any body's words. ~~~ If you will have such ideas!	je laisse chacun dire ce qu'il veut ; s'il vous plait de penser ainsi !	-0.00535714
But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men."	Mais il me semble que ses attentions ressemblent a celles de tout le monde.	0.428571
"My dear Miss Elliot!"	-- Ma chere miss Elliot !	0.285
exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes, and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.	dit Mme Clay levant les mains et les yeux au ciel et affectant un silence etudie.	0.156716
"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.	-- Ma chere Penelope, ne prenez pas l'alarme.	0.533333
I did invite him, you know. ~~~ I sent him away with smiles.	Je l'ai invite, puis congedie avec un sourire : j'ai eu pitie de lui.	-0.028125
When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him."	>> Anna admira la dissimulation de Mme Clay, qui paraissait attendre avec un tel plaisir celui qui venait contre-carrer ses plans.	0.267
Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object.		-0.3
It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise.	Il etait impossible qu'elle ne detestat pas M. Elliot, et cependant il lui fallait prendre un air calme, obligeant et se montrer satisfaite d'etre une simple amie pour Sir Walter, tandis qu'elle aurait bien voulu etre autre chose.	0.416733
To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.		-0.3
She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but now she saw insincerity in everything.		-0.3
His attentive deference to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his artificial good sentiments.		-0.3
She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side.	Anna eprouva, en voyant M. Elliot, un penible embarras.	0.10625
It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along.	Maintenant qu'elle voyait clairement sa faussete, sa deference et ses attentions pour Sir Walter etaient odieuses ; et, songeant a sa conduite avec M. Shmith, elle pouvait a peine supporter ses sourires, son air affable et l'expression de ses sentiments artificiels.	0.371429
She was accordingly more guarded, and more cool, than she had been the night before.	Elle ne voulait ni explications, ni rupture, mais etre aussi froide que la parente le permettait.	0.249296
He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others.		-0.3
He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable.		-0.3
She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part of two days.	Elle fut bien aise d'apprendre qu'il quittait Bath pour deux jours.	0.172414
He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.	Le lendemain elle annonca son intention d'aller passer la matinee chez lady Russel.	0.141667
It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.		-0.3
It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them!		-0.3
Mrs Clay's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.		-0.3
On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.		-0.3
She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street.	<< Tres bien, dit Elisabeth : faites-lui mes compliments ; c'est tout ce que j'ai a lui dire.	0.253247
"Very well," said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send but my love.	Rendez-lui aussi cet ennuyeux livre qu'elle a voulu me preter.	0.294444
Oh! ~~~ you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through.	Je ne puis pourtant pas m'ennuyer a lire tous les poemes ou toutes les statistiques qui paraissent.	-0.00357143
I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.		-0.3
Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.	Lady Russel est insupportable avec ses nouvelles publications.	0.916667
You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.	Je l'ai trouvee horriblement mise hier soir ; mais il n'est pas necessaire que vous le lui disiez.	0.196721
I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the concert.	Je croyais qu'elle avait un peu de gout, et j'ai eu honte d'elle.	0.222222
Something so formal and _arrang _ in her air!	Un air officiel et apprete.	0.125
and she sits so upright!	Et elle se tient si raide !	0.285714
My best love, of course."	Faites-lui mes meilleurs compliments, cela va sans dire.	-0.0818182
"And mine," added Sir Walter.	-- Et les miens aussi, ajouta Sir Walter, et vous pouvez dire que j'ai l'intention d'aller bientot la voir.	0.0615385
"Kindest regards.	Soyez polie.	0.175
And you may say, that I mean to call upon her soon. ~~~ Make a civil message; but I shall only leave my card.	Mais je me contenterai de laisser ma carte, il ne faut pas faire de visites le matin a de vieilles femmes.	-0.00174419
Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.	Si seulement elle mettait du rouge, elle ne craindrait pas qu'on la voie.	0.227419
If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately."		-0.3
While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door. ~~~ Who could it be?	La derniere fois que j'y suis alle, les jalousies ont ete baissees immediatement.	-0.025
Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.		-0.3
After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard, and "Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove" were ushered into the room.	>> Tandis qu'il parlait, on frappa, et M. et Mme Charles Musgrove furent introduits.	0.316667
Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.		-0.3
They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the White Hart.	La surprise fut grande : mais Anna seule fut contente ; les autres etaient indifferents.	0.269118
So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw upon Charles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.		-0.3
She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and Captain Harville, beside their two selves. ~~~ He gave her a very plain, intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.	Cependant, aussitot qu'on sut qu'ils n'avaient pas l'intention de s'installer a la maison, Sir Walter et Elisabeth devinrent plus aimables et firent les honneurs de la maison.	0.0143478
The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on business.	Elisabeth conduisit Marie dans un autre salon pour lui en faire admirer les magnificences.	0.273077
He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.		-0.3
But then, it had been taken up by his father and mother.	Anna, restee seule avec Charles, sut alors que Henriette et Benwick etaient du voyage.	0.117391
His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience.		-0.3
They had arrived late the night before.	Voici comment ceci avait ete decide.	0.28125
Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross. ~~~ Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.	Ce dernier ayant affaire a Bath, Charles s'etait propose pour venir avec lui ; mais Marie ne supporta pas l'idee de rester seule et mit tout projet en suspens.	-0.042233
She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the young people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa's.		-0.3
"And a very good living it was," Charles added: "only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.	Heureusement Mme Musgrove mere se decida a venir a Bath avec Henriette pour acheter les toilettes de noces de ses deux filles, et elle emmena Marie.	0.54
In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation.	Anna apprit que, Charles Hayter ayant obtenu une cure provisoire, les deux familles avaient consenti au mariage de leurs enfants.	0.369498
Not that he will value it as he ought," he observed, "Charles is too cool about sporting. ~~~ That's the worst of him."	<< Je suis bien heureuse d'apprendre, dit Anna, que les deux soeurs qui s'aiment tant et qui ont un egal merite, aient trouve une situation egale.	-0.0386598
"I am extremely glad, indeed," cried Anne, "particularly glad that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well, and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.		-0.3
I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both."	J'espere que votre pere et votre mere sont tout a fait heureux.	0.283019
"Oh! ~~~ yes. ~~~ My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer, but he has no other fault to find.	-- Mon pere aimerait autant que ses futurs gendres fussent plus riches ; mais c'est la leur seul defaut.	-0.102353
Money, you know, coming down with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation, and it streightens him as to many things.	Marier deux filles a la fois n'est pas une operation financiere tres agreable ; cela diminue singulierement les ressources de mon pere.	0.406957
However, I do not mean to say they have not a right to it.		-0.3
It is very fit they should have daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind, liberal father to me.	Je ne dis pas que mes soeurs n'y aient pas droit : mon pere s'est toujours montre tres liberal envers moi.	0.405329
Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.		-0.3
She never did, you know.		-0.3
But she does not do him justice, nor think enough about Winthrop.		-0.3
I cannot make her attend to the value of the property. ~~~ It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now."	Mais Marie n'approuve qu'a demi le mariage de Henriette : elle ne rend pas justice a Hayter, et ne pense pas assez a Wenthrop.	0.0385714
"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove," exclaimed Anne, "should be happy in their children's marriages.		-0.3
They do everything to confer happiness, I am sure.	Je ne puis lui faire admettre la valeur de la propriete.	0.272093
What a blessing to young people to be in such hands!	C'est un mariage qui a de l'avenir.	0.545
Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery, both in young and old.	J'ai toujours aime Charles, et je ne cesserai pas de l'aimer aujourd'hui.	0.00952381
I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now?"	-- J'espere que Louisa est tout a fait guerie ?	0.602564
He answered rather hesitatingly, "Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing or dancing; it is quite different.	>> Il repondit avec hesitation : << Oui, je la crois guerie ; mais elle est bien changee, on ne la voit plus courir, rire et danser.	0.176636
If one happens only to shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her, all day long."	Si l'on ferme une porte trop fort, elle tressaille et s'agite ; et Benwick s'assoit pres d'elle, lui parle bas et lui lit des vers tout le long du jour.	0.307258
Anne could not help laughing. ~~~ "That cannot be much to your taste, I know," said she; "but I do believe him to be an excellent young man." ~~~ "To be sure he is.	>> Anna ne put s'empecher de rire : << Cela n'est pas de votre gout ; mais je crois que c'est un excellent jeune homme.	-0.0668666
Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself.		-0.3
I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.	-- Certainement ; personne n'en doute, j'apprecie fort Benwick ; quand on peut le decider a parler, il cause bien.	0.353668
His reading has done him no harm, for he has fought as well as read. ~~~ He is a brave fellow.	Ses lectures ne lui ont fait aucun tort, car il se bat aussi volontiers qu'il lit.	-0.0132353
I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.		-0.3
We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since."	Nous avons eu lundi dernier une fameuse chasse aux rats dans les granges de mon pere, et il y a joue un si beau role que je l'en aime davantage.	0.363154
Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.		-0.3
She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs. ~~~ The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.	>> Ici Charles fut oblige d'aller admirer les glaces et les porcelaines de Chine mais Anna en avait entendu assez pour etre au courant et pour se rejouir.	-0.00351563
Mary was in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they were detailed to her.		-0.3
She had no demands on her father or sister, and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms. ~~~ Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.	Cependant elle soupira ; mais ce n'etait pas un soupir d'envie : elle eut bien voulu avoir la meme part de bonheur que les autres sans diminuer la leur.	-0.0302885
She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.	La visite se passa gaiement ; Marie etait de bonne humeur, et si satisfaite du voyage dans le landau a quatre chevaux de sa belle-mere, qu'elle etait disposee a admirer tout ce qu'on lui montrait.	0.274744
It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then Elizabeth was happy again.	Son importance personnelle etait rehaussee par ce bel appartement.	0.127119
These were her internal persuasions: "Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of her way. ~~~ I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy with us. ~~~ I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.	Elisabeth sentait qu'il fallait inviter a diner les Musgrove, mais elle ne pouvait supporter l'idee qu'ils verraient une diminution de serviteurs et de representation, eux si inferieurs aux Elliot de Kellynch !	-0.120253
They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.	Ce fut un combat entre les convenances et la vanite.	0.285714
They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening.	Celle-ci eut le dessus, et Elisabeth fut satisfaite.	0.27907
It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant."	Elle se dit : << Ce sont de vieilles idees de province sur l'hospitalite.	0.202174
And this satisfied Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two present, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.	On sait que nous ne donnons pas de diners ; personne ici ne le fait, et je suis sure qu'une invitation ne serait pas agreable a Mme Musgrove : elle est genee avec nous, et hors de son monde.	0.349839
She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.		-0.3
Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her and Henrietta directly.	Je les inviterai pour la soiree de demain ; ce sera une nouveaute et un plaisir : ils n'ont jamais vu deux salons comme ceux-ci.	0.188571
Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.	Ils seront ravis, ce sera une petite reunion choisie.	0.228261
They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.		-0.3
They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.		-0.3
Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress.		-0.3
It was a heartiness, and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad want of such blessings at home.	>> Marie fut parfaitement contente de cette invitation ; on devait la presenter a M. Elliot et aux illustres cousines, et rien ne pouvait lui etre plus agreable.	0.333309
She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts; from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.		-0.3
A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.	Anna sortit avec Charles et sa femme.	0.1875
A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.	Elle avait hate de revoir ses amis d'Uppercross, et elle recut le meilleur accueil.	0.238983
One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.	Henriette, dont l'ame etait epanouie par le bonheur, fut bienveillante et gracieuse.	-0.377027
The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment.	Mme Musgrove etait reconnaissante des services d'Anna.	0.195918
It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.	Ce fut une expansion, une chaleur, une sincerite qui la ravirent d'autant plus qu'elle en etait privee chez elle.	0.24375
Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.	Elle fut invitee ou plutot reclamee comme un membre de la famille, et elle reprit en retour ses habitudes serviables ecoutant l'histoire de Louisa et d'Henriette, donnant son avis sur les achats, recommandant tels magasins, s'interrompant pour aider Marie dans ses comptes, chercher ses clefs ou tacher de la convaincre qu'elle n'avait ete dupe de personne, car Marie, tout en s'amusant a regarder les passants par la fenetre, ne pouvait s'empecher de laisser travailler son imagination.	0.0897384
He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation. ~~~ She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand each other ere long.	Une nombreuse compagnie arrivant dans un hotel y porte beaucoup de bruit et de mouvement ; et Anna n'avait pas ete la une demi-heure, que la vaste salle etait a moitie remplie de boites et de paquets ; puis vinrent les amies de Mme Musgrove, et, bientot apres, Harville et Wenvorth.	-0.00579399
We are not boy and girl, to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing with our own happiness."	Il sembla a Anna qu'il etait dans la meme disposition d'esprit que le jour du concert, et qu'il voulait l'eviter.	0.230526
And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.	Elle s'efforca d'etre calme et se raisonna ainsi : << Si nous nous aimons encore, nos coeurs finiront par se comprendre ; la destinee ne nous a pas rapproches pour que nous nous cherchions des querelles absurdes.	0.364689
"Anne," cried Mary, still at her window, "there is Mrs Clay, I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.	>> << Anna, s'ecria Marie, voici Mme Clay debout sous la colonnade avec un monsieur pres d'elle.	0.207407
I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.	Ils semblent causer intimement.	0.144828
They seemed deep in talk.	Comment se nomme-t-il ?	0.285714
Who is it? ~~~ Come, and tell me.	Venez ; dites-le-moi.	-0.0375
Good heavens!		-0.3
I recollect.	Mon Dieu !	0.2
It is Mr Elliot himself."	je me souviens ; c'est M. Elliot.	0.218182
"No," cried Anne, quickly, "it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.	-- Non, s'ecria Anna vivement, ce ne peut etre lui.	0.216279
He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till to-morrow."	Il a du quitter Bath ce matin a neuf heures, et il ne reviendra que demain.	0.442044
As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret that she had said so much, simple as it was.	>> Elle sentit que Wenvorth la regardait, ce qui la vexa et l'embarrassa et lui fit regretter ce qu'elle avait dit.	0.125
Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin, began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to be cool and unconcerned.	Marie, voulant qu'on supposat qu'elle connaissait son cousin, se mit a parler des ressemblances de famille, affirma que c'etait M. Elliot, et appela encore Anna pour regarder elle-meme. ~~~ Mais Anna ne bougea pas.	0.0138256
Her distress returned, however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.	Son malaise cependant augmenta quand elle vit les sourires et les regards d'intelligence echanges entre deux ou trois dames, comme si elles se croyaient dans le secret.	0.392458
It was evident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.		-0.3
"Do come, Anne," cried Mary, "come and look yourself.	Il etait evident qu'on avait cause d'elle.	0.227027
You will be too late if you do not make haste. ~~~ They are parting; they are shaking hands.	<< Venez voir, s'ecria Marie ; ils se separent et se donnent la main.	-0.0447368
He is turning away. ~~~ Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!	Est-ce que vous ne reconnaitriez pas M. Elliot ?	-0.00365854
You seem to have forgot all about Lyme."	Vous semblez avoir oublie Lyme.	0.235714
To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move quietly to the window.	>> Pour cacher son embarras, Anna alla vivement a la fenetre.	0.138462
She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, "Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.		-0.3
He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;" and walked back to her chair, recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.	Elle s'assura que c'etaient Mme Clay et M. Elliot, et, reprimant sa surprise, elle dit tranquillement : << Oui, c'est M. Elliot.	0.127778
The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with-- "Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.		-0.3
I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.		-0.3
A'n't I a good boy? ~~~ I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.	Il a change son heure de depart, voila tout ; ou je puis m'etre trompee.	0.107143
It holds nine. ~~~ I have engaged Captain Wentworth. ~~~ Anne will not be sorry to join us, I am sure.	>> Elle revint s'asseoir avec l'espoir consolant d'avoir paru indifferente.	-0.1
We all like a play. ~~~ Have not I done well, mother?" ~~~ Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming-- "Good heavens, Charles!	Les dames partirent ; Charles, apres avoir maudit leur visite, dit : << Mere, j'ai fait quelque chose qui vous fera plaisir ; j'ai loue une loge pour demain, et j'ai invite Wenvorth, je suis sur qu'Anna ne sera pas fachee de venir avec nous.	-0.10202
how can you think of such a thing?	N'ai-je pas bien fait ?	0.18
Take a box for to-morrow night!	-- Bonte du ciel, s'ecria Marie.	0.288889
Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night?	Qu'avez-vous fait ?	-0.366667
and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them? ~~~ How can you be so forgetful?"	Avez-vous oublie que nous sommes engages a Camben-Place, et que nous y rencontrerons lady Dalrymph, M. Elliot et les principaux parents de la famille ?	-0.0210938
"Phoo! ~~~ phoo!" ~~~ replied Charles, "what's an evening party?	-- Bah, repondit Charles ; qu'est-ce que c'est qu'une soiree ?	-0.115217
Never worth remembering.		-0.3
Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he had wanted to see us.	Votre pere pouvait nous inviter a diner, s'il voulait nous voir.	0.250909
You may do as you like, but I shall go to the play."	Faites ce que vous voudrez ; moi, j'irai au spectacle.	0.263415
"Oh!	-- Oh !	0.24
Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you promised to go."	Charles, ce serait abominable, quand vous avez promis.	0.514583
"No, I did not promise. ~~~ I only smirked and bowed, and said the word 'happy.'	-- Non ; j'ai seulement salue et souri, en disant : << Trop heureux !	-0.0241071
There was no promise."	>> Ce n'est pas la une promesse.	0.195
"But you must go, Charles. ~~~ It would be unpardonable to fail.	-- Vous irez, Charles ; ce serait impardonnable d'y manquer.	-0.00288462
We were asked on purpose to be introduced.		-0.3
There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.	On doit nous presenter ; il y a toujours eu une grande liaison entre les Dalrymph et nous.	0.499426
Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.		-0.3
We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!	Et M. Elliot est l'heritier de mon pere ; des attentions lui sont dues a ce titre.	0.350249
Every attention is due to Mr Elliot.		-0.3
Consider, my father's heir: the future representative of the family."		-0.3
"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried Charles. ~~~ "I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun.	-- Ne me parlez pas d'heritiers, s'ecria Charles : je ne suis pas de ceux qui negligent le pouvoir regnant pour s'incliner devant l'astre nouveau.	0
If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.	Si je n'y allais pas pour votre pere, il serait scandaleux d'y aller pour son heritier.	0.250685
What is Mr Elliot to me?"	Qu'est-ce que M. Elliot est pour moi ?	0.571429
The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.	>> Cette expression d'insouciance ranima Anna, qui vit le capitaine regarder et ecouter avec attention, Aux dernieres paroles de Charles, il la regarda.	0.444656
Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she, invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play without her. ~~~ Mrs Musgrove interposed. ~~~ "We had better put it off.	Charles et Marie continuaient a discuter le projet de spectacle : Mme Musgrove s'interposa.	-0.0934783
Charles, you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday.	<< Il vaut mieux y renoncer, Charles, et demander la loge pour mardi.	0.509023
It would be a pity to be divided, and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play, if Miss Anne could not be with us."	Ce serait dommage d'etre separes, et nous y perdrions aussi miss Anna ; et si elle n'est pas avec nous, ni Henriette ni moi nous ne nous soucions du spectacle.	0.206107
Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying-- "If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home (excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.	>> Anna fut sincerement reconnaissante de ces paroles ; elle dit d'un ton decide : << S'il ne dependait que de moi, madame, la soiree a la maison ne serait pas le plus petit obstacle.	0.172
I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it for a play, and with you.	Je n'ai aucun plaisir a ces presentations, et je serais trop heureuse d'aller au theatre avec vous.	0.466667
But, it had better not be attempted, perhaps."		-0.3
She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to try to observe their effect.	>> Elle sentit qu'on l'observait, et n'osa pas meme lever les yeux pour voir l'effet de ses paroles. ~~~ On convint du mardi.	-0.0276699
It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.	Charles se reserva seulement de taquiner sa femme en declarant qu'il irait seul au spectacle, si personne ne voulait y aller.	0.266552
Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.	Le capitaine Wenvorth quitta sa place, et vint s'arreter comme par hasard devant Anna.	-0.0324324
"You have not been long enough in Bath," said he, "to enjoy the evening parties of the place."	<< Vous n'avez pas ete assez longtemps a Bath, dit-il, pour jouir des soirees qu'on y donne.	0.296104
"Oh! ~~~ no. ~~~ The usual character of them has nothing for me.	-- Ces soirees ne me plaisent pas, je ne suis pas joueuse.	-0.106667
I am no card-player."		-0.3
"You were not formerly, I know. ~~~ You did not use to like cards; but time makes many changes."	-- Je sais que vous ne l'etiez pas autrefois ; mais le temps opere de grands changements.	-0.00810811
"I am not yet so much changed," cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction.	-- Je n'ai pas tant change, >> dit-elle ; puis elle s'arreta, craignant quelque interpretation.	0.281707
After waiting a few moments he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, "It is a period, indeed! ~~~ Eight years and a half is a period."	Quelques instants apres, il dit, comme si c'etait une reflexion soudaine : << Il y a un siecle, vraiment : huit ans et demi !	0.048913
Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in. ~~~ They were obliged to move.	>> Anna ne put savoir s'il en aurait dit davantage ; Henriette demanda a sortir, et Anna dissimula sa contrariete ; elle se dit que si Henriette l'avait su, elle en aurait eu pitie, elle qui etait si sure de l'affection de son fiance.	-0.0385417
Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity her. ~~~ Their preparations, however, were stopped short.		-0.3
Alarming sounds were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.	Sir Walter et Elisabeth vinrent interrompre leurs apprets de depart : leur presence apporta un froid general.	0.496099
Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same.	Anna se sentit oppressee, et vit la meme impression autour d'elle.	0.231579
The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.	Le bien-etre, la liberte, la gaite, disparurent ; un froid maintien, un silence compasse, une conversation insipide, accueillirent son pere et sa soeur.	0.251908
How mortifying to feel that it was so!	Quelle mortification c'etait pour elle !	0.2625
Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.		-0.3
Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.		-0.3
She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once. ~~~ Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.	Cependant elle eut une satisfaction : le capitaine Wenvorth fut salue par sa soeur plus gracieusement que la premiere fois.	-0.0123711
The sequel explained it. ~~~ After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves. ~~~ "To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends: no formal party."	Elisabeth renouvela son invitation pour tous les Musgrove, << une soiree intime, >> dit-elle, et, posant sur la table les lettres d'invitation qu'elle avait apportees, elle adressa un sourire a Wenvorth en lui en presentant une.	-0.0381982
It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had provided herself, the "Miss Elliot at home," were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.		-0.3
The truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his. ~~~ The past was nothing.	Elle avait reflechi qu'un homme d'une telle tournure ferait bien dans son salon, et elle consentait a oublier le passe.	0.0580622
The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing-room.		-0.3
The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.	Quand Sir Walter et Elisabeth furent partis, l'animation et la gaite reparurent, excepte pour Anna.	0.66
The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not to Anne.	Elle pensait a la maniere douteuse dont Wenvorth avait remercie plutot qu'accepte l'invitation, montrant plus de surprise que de plaisir.	0.287395
She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.	Elle savait qu'il ne pouvait regarder cette invitation comme une excuse pour le passe.	-0.0554054
She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for all the insolence of the past.	Il tint la carte dans sa main apres leur depart, comme s'il reflechissait a tout cela.	0
Her spirits sank. ~~~ He held the card in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.	<< Pensez-donc qu'Elisabeth a invite tout le monde, chuchota Marie assez haut pour etre entendue.	-0.00365854
"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!"	Je ne suis pas surprise que le capitaine soit ravi.	0.293023
whispered Mary very audibly.	Vous voyez qu'il ne peut pas se separer de sa carte.	0.103846
"I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!	>> Anna saisit le regard de Wenvorth ; elle vit sa joue rougir, et sa bouche exprimer le mepris.	0.0357143
You see he cannot put the card out of his hand."	Elle se detourna pour ne pas en voir davantage.	0.292308
Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.		-0.3
The party separated.	On se separa.	0.125
The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne belonged to them.	Anna, sollicitee de rester a diner, refusa. ~~~ Elle avait besoin de calme et de silence apres les agitations de la journee.	-0.0101942
She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose.	Revenue a Camben-Place, elle eut a entendre tous les projets d'Elisabeth et de Mme Clay pour la soiree, tous les details d'embellissement, l'enumeration des invites, tout ce qui ferait de cette soiree la plus elegante qu'on eut jamais vue a Bath.	0.286364
Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?		-0.3
They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.	Pendant ce temps, elle etait obsedee par une pensee unique : << Viendra-t-il ? ~~~ >> Elle ne pouvait deviner s'il se croirait oblige de venir.	-0.027
She generally thought he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.	Elle oublia un moment sa preoccupation pour dire a Mme Clay qu'elle l'avait vue causer avec M. Elliot.	0.0811506
She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation, to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened.		-0.3
It was transient: cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter.	Elle crut voir sur sa figure une certaine confusion, qui pouvait bien etre causee par des reproches ou des observations de M. Elliot.	-0.075
She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:-- "Oh!	Elle s'ecria cependant d'un air assez naturel : << Ah !	0.182609
dear!	c'est vrai !	0.05
very true.	ma chere.	0.266667
Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.	Croiriez-vous, miss Elliot, que j'ai rencontre M. Elliot dans la rue Bath ?	0.924107
I was never more astonished. ~~~ He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.	Je n'ai jamais ete plus etonnee ; nous avons fait quelques pas ensemble.	-0.0172131
He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.	Quelque chose l'avait empeche de partir ; je ne sais plus quoi, car j'etais pressee et je ne pouvais guere attendre...	0.0909091
He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.		-0.3
He was full of 'to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head."	Il voulait savoir a quelle heure il pourrait etre recu demain, il ne pensait qu'a votre soiree, et moi aussi, et meme depuis que je suis rentree ; sans cela, cette rencontre ne me serait pas si entierement sortie de la memoire.	0.279144
Chapter 23 One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith; but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.		-0.3
She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.	>> CHAPITRE XXIII Anna ayant promis d'aller chez les Musgrove, elle remit au lendemain la visite a lady Russel.	0.105263
Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another day.	Un jour de plus etait accorde a la bonne reputation de M. Elliot, comme a la sultane Sheherazade des Mille et une Nuits.	0.296939
She could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to attempt the walk.	Le mauvais temps la mit en retard, et quand elle arriva chez les Musgrove, elle y trouva Mme Croft, Harville et Wenvorth.	0.0594059
When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.	Marie et Henriette ne l'avaient pas attendue ; mais elles avaient recommande a Mme Musgrove de la retenir jusqu'a leur retour.	0.252336
The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned.		-0.3
She had only to submit, sit down, be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed. ~~~ There was no delay, no waste of time.	Elle dut se soumettre, et fut bientot plongee dans toutes les agitations que l'extreme bonheur et l'extreme chagrin peuvent procurer.	0.00881988
She was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such happiness, instantly.	Deux minutes apres son arrivee, Wenvorth dit a Harville.	0.140816
Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said-- "We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you will give me materials."	<< Nous ecrirons la lettre en question, Harville, si vous voulez me donner ce qu'il faut pour ecrire.	0.446378
Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.	>> Tout etant prepare, il s'approcha de la table et, tournant le dos a tous, il s'absorba dans sa lettre.	0.384236
Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.	Mme Musgrove racontait a Mme Croft comment le mariage de sa fille s'etait decide, avec cet insupportable chuchotement que tout le monde peut entendre.	0.585
Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as, "how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well," and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals.		-0.3
Mrs Croft was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly.	Anna ne put eviter d'entendre certains details et des rabachages insipides que Mme Croft ecoutait avec une attention bienveillante.	0.364314
Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear.	Anna esperait que Wenvorth n'entendait pas.	0.138462
"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered," said Mrs Musgrove, in her powerful whisper, "though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.	<< Tout bien considere, disait Mme Musgrove, nous avons juge convenable de ne pas attendre davantage ; Charles Hayter se mourait d'impatience.	0.199501
At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement." ~~~ "That is precisely what I was going to observe," cried Mrs Croft.	Je ne hais rien tant que les longs engagements ; six mois, un an tout au plus, mais pas davantage.	-0.0525
"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in a long engagement. ~~~ I always think that no mutual--" "Oh!	-- C'est precisement ce que j'allais vous dire ; surtout quand on ignore s'il ne surviendra pas quelque obstacle ; je trouve cela tres imprudent, et les parents devraient l'empecher autant qu'ils peuvent.	0.00634328
dear Mrs Croft," cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her finish her speech, "there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement.	J'aimerais mieux voir les jeunes gens se marier avec un petit revenu, et lutter avec les difficultes de la vie que d'etre lies longtemps d'avance.	0.295041
It is what I always protested against for my children.	>> Anna trouvait la un interet inattendu.	0.216667
It is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--" "Yes, dear ma'am," said Mrs Croft, "or an uncertain engagement, an engagement which may be long.	Elle s'appliqua ces paroles, sentit un fremissement parcourir tout son corps, et jeta involontairement un regard sur la table. ~~~ Le capitaine avait cesse d'ecrire : il ecouta et se retourna pour lui jeter un regard rapide et profond.	-0.0213198
To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can."	Les deux dames continuerent a redire les memes verites, a les renforcer par des exemples.	0.203289
Anne found an unexpected interest here.	Mais Anna n'entendit qu'un bruit de voix ; tout etait confusion dans son esprit.	0.0171429
She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her.		-0.3
The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion.		-0.3
Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.	Harville, qui n'avait rien entendu, s'approcha d'une fenetre et parut inviter Anna a le rejoindre.	0.233824
He looked at her with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, "Come to me, I have something to say;" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation. ~~~ She roused herself and went to him.		-0.3
The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near.	Il la regarda avec un sourire et fit un petit mouvement de tete qui disait : << Venez, j'ai quelque chose a vous dire.	0.178125
As she joined him, Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character.	>> Anna alla vers lui ; alors il reprit l'expression serieuse et pensive qui lui etait habituelle.	0.180723
"Look here," said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a small miniature painting, "do you know who that is?"	<< Voyez, dit-il, deployant un paquet qu'il avait dans la main et montrant une miniature.	0.193421
"Certainly: Captain Benwick."	Connaissez-vous cette personne ?	0.278571
"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.	-- Certainement, capitaine.	0.242308
But," (in a deep tone,) "it was not done for her.	-- Et vous pouvez deviner a qui ce portrait est destine.	0.4975
Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?	Mais, dit-il d'une voix grave, il n'a pas ete fait pour elle. ~~~ Miss Elliot, vous rappelez-vous notre promenade a Lyme ?	0.241837
I little thought then--but no matter.	Nous nous affligions pour lui.	0.233333
This was drawn at the Cape.	Je ne croyais guere alors.	0.3
He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!	Mais, n'importe. ~~~ La peinture a ete faite au Cap. ~~~ Harville rencontra la un jeune artiste allemand, et pour remplir une promesse faite a ma pauvre soeur, il posa, et lui rapporta ce portrait.	-0.0806897
It was a commission to me!	Je suis charge maintenant de le donner a une autre femme.	0.374026
But who else was there to employ?	Quelle commission pour moi !	0.264
I hope I can allow for him.	mais qui pouvait la faire ?	0.286364
I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another.		-0.3
He undertakes it;" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,) "he is writing about it now."		-0.3
And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, "Poor Fanny!	Je ne suis pas fache, vraiment, de la laisser a un autre, dit-il en designant Wenvorth.	0.422414
she would not have forgotten him so soon!"	Le capitaine s'en charge ; c'est pour cela qu'il ecrit.	0.208333
"No," replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice.	>> Et il ajouta, avec une levre tremblante : << Pauvre Fanny !	0.197368
"That I can easily believe."	Elle ne l'aurait pas oublie sitot !	0.24
"It was not in her nature. ~~~ She doted on him."	-- Non, dit Anna d'une voix penetree, je le crois facilement.	-0.05
"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved."	-- Ce n'etait pas dans sa nature : elle l'adorait.	0.52987
Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Do you claim that for your sex?"	-- Une femme qui aime vraiment est ainsi.	0.0514286
and she answered the question, smiling also, "Yes.	>> Harville eut un sourire qui signifiait : << Reclamez-vous pour votre sexe ?	0.15
We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us. ~~~ It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.	>> et Anna repondit, en souriant aussi : << Oui, nous ne sommes pas si oublieuses que vous ; c'est peut-etre notre destinee plutot que notre merite.	-0.062069
We cannot help ourselves.	Nous n'y pouvons rien.	0.255
We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. ~~~ You are forced on exertion.	Nous vivons a l'interieur, tranquilles, renfermees, et nous n'existons que par le sentiment.	-0.00379747
You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions."	Vous etes forces a l'action ; vous avez toujours quelque affaire qui vous ramene dans le monde ; le changement et l'occupation continuels affaiblissent bientot vos impressions.	0.405156
"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men (which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to Benwick.	-- En admettant (ce que je ne fais pas) que votre assertion soit vraie, elle ne s'applique pas a Benwick.	0.468473
He has not been forced upon any exertion.		-0.3
The peace turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our little family circle, ever since."	Il n'a pas ete force a l'action ; la paix l'a ramene a terre a ce moment-la, et depuis il a toujours vecu avec nous.	0.274194
"True," said Anne, "very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we say now, Captain Harville?	-- C'est tres vrai, dit Anna ; je l'avais oublie. ~~~ Mais qu'allez-vous repondre a cela, capitaine ?	-0.00555556
If the change be not from outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick."	Si le changement ne vient pas des circonstances exterieures, il vient du dedans, de la nature de l'homme, ce doit etre le cas du capitaine Benwick.	0.282927
"No, no, it is not man's nature. ~~~ I will not allow it to be more man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved.	-- Non, non, je n'admets pas que ce soit la nature de l'homme plus que de la femme d'oublier ceux qu'on aime ou qu'on a aimes.	0.052268
I believe the reverse.	Je crois le contraire.	0.3
I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage, and riding out the heaviest weather."	Il y a une veritable analogie entre notre corps et notre esprit ; la ou le corps est le plus fort, le sentiment l'est aussi : il est capable de supporter une plus rude epreuve, comme d'affronter un plus mauvais temps.	0.44743
"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied Anne, "but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.	-- Vos sentiments peuvent etre les plus forts, dit Anna ; mais le meme esprit d'analogie m'autorise a dire que les notres sont les plus tendres.	0.297479
Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.	L'homme est plus robuste que la femme, mais il ne vit pas plus longtemps, ce qui explique mes idees sur la nature de ses affections.	0.410577
Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.	S'il en etait autrement, ce serait trop cruel pour vous.	0.293617
You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with. ~~~ You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.	Vous avez a lutter avec des dangers, des souffrances ; vous travaillez et vous fatiguez votre temps ; votre sante, votre vie, ne sont pas a vous.	-0.0125
Your home, country, friends, all quitted. ~~~ Neither time, nor health, nor life, to be called your own.	Ce serait cruel vraiment (ceci fut dit d'une voix tremblante) si les sentiments des femmes etaient ajoutes a tout cela.	-0.0241379
It would be hard, indeed" (with a faltering voice), "if woman's feelings were to be added to all this."	-- Nous ne serons jamais d'accord sur ce point, >> commenca Harville, quand un leger bruit attira son attention.	0.268605
"We shall never agree upon this question," Captain Harville was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.	La plume de Wenvorth etait tombee de ses mains, et Anna tressaillit en s'apercevant qu'il etait plus pres qu'elle ne croyait.	0.130189
It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could have caught.		-0.3
"Have you finished your letter?"	-- Avez-vous fini votre lettre ?	0.289286
said Captain Harville.	dit Harville.	1.11538
"Not quite, a few lines more. ~~~ I shall have done in five minutes."	-- Pas encore, quelques lignes seulement : j'aurai fini dans cinq minutes.	-0.0214286
"There is no hurry on my side. ~~~ I am only ready whenever you are.	-- Rien ne presse ; je suis tres bien ancre ici, dit-il en souriant a Anna ; bien approvisionne ; je ne manque de rien.	-0.116667
I am in very good anchorage here," (smiling at Anne,) "well supplied, and want for nothing. ~~~ No hurry for a signal at all.	Eh bien, miss Elliot, dit-il en baissant la voix, comme je vous le disais, nous ne serons jamais d'accord sur ce point ; aucun homme ni aucune femme ne peuvent l'etre sans doute : mais laissez-moi vous dire que l'histoire est contre vous, en prose et en vers.	-0.163235
Well, Miss Elliot," (lowering his voice,) "as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose, upon this point.	Si j'avais autant de memoire que Benwick, j'apporterais cinquante citations pour appuyer ma these.	0.282558
No man and woman, would, probably. ~~~ But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and verse.	Je ne crois pas avoir ouvert dans ma vie un seul livre qui n'ait parle de l'inconstance des femmes.	-0.0208333
If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy.		-0.3

Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books.	-- Oui, s'il vous plait, ne prenons pas pour arbitres les livres.	0.27
Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. ~~~ Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands.	Les hommes, en ecrivant l'histoire, ont sur nous tous les avantages ; ils ont plus d'instruction, et la plume est dans leurs mains.	-0.0190909
I will not allow books to prove anything."	Je n'admets pas que les livres prouvent quelque chose.	0.208333
"But how shall we prove anything?"	-- Mais quelle preuve aurons-nous ?	0.29
"We never shall.	-- Nous n'en aurons jamais.	0.12
We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point. ~~~ It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof. ~~~ We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said."	Nous debutons chacun avec une prevention en faveur de notre propre sexe ; nous y ajoutons toutes les preuves que nous pouvons trouver a l'appui, et precisement ces preuves ne peuvent etre donnees sans trahir un secret.	-0.109812
"Ah!"	-- Ah !	0.3
cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, "if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knows whether we ever meet again!'	s'ecria Harville d'un ton profondement emu, si je pouvais vous faire comprendre tout ce qu'eprouve un homme, quand, jetant un dernier regard sur sa femme et ses enfants, il suit des yeux le bateau qui les emporte, et se demande s'il les reverra jamais.	0.247143
And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!	Si je pouvais vous dire la joie de son ame quand il les revoit apres, une longue absence ; quand il a calcule l'heure de leur retour, et qu'il les voit arriver un jour plus tot, comme si le ciel leur avait donne des ailes !	0.0202544
If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!	Si je pouvais vous dire tout ce qu'un homme peut faire et supporter ; tout ce qu'il peut se glorifier de faire pour ses chers tresors !	0.294545

God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!		-0.3
I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.	Je meriterais le mepris si j'osais supposer que la veritable affection et la confiance appartiennent seulement aux femmes.	0.26875
No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives.	Non, je vous crois capables dans le mariage de toutes les grandes et nobles choses.	0.276923
I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have an object.	Je crois que vous pouvez supporter beaucoup tant que... (permettez-moi de le dire), tant que vous avez un but.	0.16129
I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.	Je veux dire tant que la femme que vous aimez existe et vit pour vous.	0.23617
All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone."	Le seul privilege que je reclame pour mon sexe (et il n'est pas tres enviable, n'en soyez pas jaloux), c'est d'aimer plus longtemps quand il n'y a plus ni vie ni espoir.	0.461049
She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed.	>> Elle ne put en dire davantage ; son coeur etait trop plein, sa poitrine trop oppressee.	0.22

Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either could not or would not answer fully.	Ce soir, nous aurons le plaisir de nous rencontrer tous a votre soiree, >> dit-elle a Anna.	0.419298
"Yes," said he, "very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a minute.	<< Nous avons recu hier l'invitation de votre soeur, et j'ai compris que Frederic etait invite aussi.	0.177907
I know you will not be sorry to be off.	Vous etes libre, n'est-ce pas, Frederic ?	0.251613
I shall be at your service in half a minute."	>> Wenvorth pliait sa lettre a la hate, il ne put ou ne voulut pas repondre a cela.	0.329484
Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.	<< Oui, dit-il, nous nous separons ; mais nous vous suivrons bientot, c'est-a-dire Harville, si vous etes pret, je le suis dans une minute ; je sais que vous ne serez pas fache d'etre dehors.	0.290196
Anne knew not how to understand it.	>> Wenvorth, ayant cachete rapidement sa lettre, semblait presse de partir.	-0.06
She had the kindest "Good morning, God bless you!"	Anna n'y comprenait rien.	0.0391304
from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look! ~~~ He had passed out of the room without a look!	Harville lui dit un amical adieu ; mais de Wenvorth elle n'eut pas un mot, pas un regard, quand il sortit.	0
She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it was himself.	Elle n'avait eu que le temps de s'approcher de la table, quand la porte s'ouvrit, et qu'il rentra.	0.135366
He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it: the work of an instant!	Il s'excusa, disant qu'il avait oublie ses gants ; il s'approcha de la table, et, tirant une lettre de dessous les autres papiers, la mit sous les yeux d'Anna en la regardant d'un air suppliant, puis il sortit avant que Mme Musgrove eut le temps de voir s'il etait entre.	0.295226
The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond expression.	Anna fut agitee au dela de toute expression.	0.388596
The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to "Miss A. E.--," was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily.	La lettre, dont l'adresse << Miss A. E. >> etait a peine lisible, etait celle qu'il avait pliee si rapidement.	0.549845
While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been also addressing her!		-0.3
On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her.	On croyait qu'il ecrivait a Benwick, et c'etait a elle !	0.435106
Anything was possible, anything might be defied rather than suspense.	La vie d'Anna dependait du contenu de cette lettre !	0.184091
Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following words: "I can listen no longer in silence.	Mais tout etait preferable a l'attente, Mme Musgrove etait occupee ailleurs, et Anna put, sans etre apercue, lire ce qui suit : << Je ne puis me taire plus longtemps.	0.179383

Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.	>> Apres cette lecture, Anna fut longtemps a se remettre.	0.505227
Half an hour's solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.	Chaque instant augmentait son agitation : elle etait comme ecrasee de bonheur et avant qu'elle put sortir de cet etat violent, Charles, Marie et Henriette rentrerent.	0.20493
Every moment rather brought fresh agitation. ~~~ It was overpowering happiness.	Elle s'efforca d'etre calme, mais elle ne comprit pas un mot de ce qu'on disait.	-0.00447761
And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.	Elle fut obligee de s'excuser et de dire qu'elle etait souffrante.	0.147368
The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.	On remarqua alors qu'elle etait tres pale, qu'elle paraissait agitee et preoccupee, et l'on ne voulut pas sortir sans elle.	0.297115
She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself.		-0.3
They could then see that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her for the world.		-0.3
This was dreadful.	Cela etait cruel !...	0.264706
Would they only have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home.		-0.3
"By all means, my dear," cried Mrs Musgrove, "go home directly, and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.	Si seulement on etait parti, lui laissant la tranquille possession de cette chambre !	0.168493
I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself. ~~~ Charles, ring and order a chair. ~~~ She must not walk."	mais voir tout le monde autour d'elle lui donnait le vertige et la desesperait.	-0.119403
But the chair would never do. ~~~ Worse than all!	Elle dit qu'elle voulait retourner chez elle.	0
To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet, solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him) could not be borne.		-0.3
The chair was earnestly protested against, and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at night.		-0.3
Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said-- "I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.	<< Certainement, ma chere, dit Mme Musgrove ; partez vite, et prenez soin de vous, afin d'etre bien remise ce soir.	0.26875
Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening.		-0.3
I am afraid there had been some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."		-0.3
"Oh! ~~~ my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.	Charles, demandez une voiture ; elle ne peut pas marcher.	0
Captain Harville has no thought but of going." ~~~ "Do you think so?	>> Aller en voiture, c'etait la le pire, perdre la possibilite de dire deux mots au capitaine !	-0.0616071
But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.	Elle ne pouvait supporter cette pensee.	0.274286
Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?	Elle protesta vivement, et on la laissa enfin partir.	0.280435
You will see them both this morning, I dare say.		-0.3
Do promise me." ~~~ "To be sure I will, if you wish it. ~~~ Charles, if you see Captain Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.	<< Soyez assez bonne, madame, dit-elle en sortant, pour dire a ces messieurs que nous esperons les avoir tous ce soir, et particulierement le capitaine Benwick et M. Wenvorth.	-0.145098
But indeed, my dear, you need not be uneasy.	>> Elle craignait quelque malentendu qui gaterait son bonheur.	0.154054
Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say."	Une autre contrariete survint : Charles voulut l'accompagner, cela etait cruel, mais elle ne pouvait s'y refuser.	0.287234
Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity.	Arrives a la rue Union, un pas rapide et qui lui etait familier se fit entendre derriere eux.	0.264935
It could not be very lasting, however.	Elle eut le temps de se preparer a voir Wenvorth.	0.227273
Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.	Il les rejoignit, puis parut indecis sur ce qu'il devait faire ; il se tut et la regarda.	0.168493
Another momentary vexation occurred.	Elle soutint ce regard en rougissant.	0.290909
Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him.		-0.3
This was almost cruel. ~~~ But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.		-0.3
They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth.		-0.3
He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.		-0.3
Anne could command herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.	Alors l'indecision de Wenvorth cessa et il marcha a cote d'elle.	0.24
The cheeks which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated were decided.	Charles, frappe d'une pensee soudaine, dit tout a coup : << Capitaine, ou allez-vous ?	0.271233
He walked by her side.	A Gay-Street, ou plus loin ?	0.221053
Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said-- "Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?		-0.3
Only to Gay Street, or farther up the town?"	-- Je n'en sais rien, dit Wenvorth surpris.	0.3
"I hardly know," replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.		-0.3
"Are you going as high as Belmont?	-- Allez-vous pres de Camben-Place ?	0.268966
Are you going near Camden Place?		-0.3
Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.	parce qu'alors je n'ai aucun scrupule a vous prier de me remplacer, et de donner votre bras a Anna.	0.241463
She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place.	Elle est un peu souffrante ce matin et ne doit pas aller seule si loin ; et il faut que j'aille chez mon armurier.	0.26087
He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.	Il m'a promis de me faire voir un superbe fusil qu'il va expedier, et si je n'y vais pas tout de suite il sera trop tard.	0.219359
By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day round Winthrop."	>> Wenvorth n'avait aucune objection a faire a cela, il s'empressa d'accepter, reprimant un sourire et une joie folle.	0.45
There could not be an objection. ~~~ There could be only the most proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.	Une minute apres, Charles etait au bout de la rue, et Wenvorth et Anna se dirigeaient vers la promenade tranquille, pour causer librement pendant cette heure benie, qu'ils se rappelleraient toujours avec bonheur.	-0.0240385
In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding together: and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.		-0.3
There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so many, many years of division and estrangement.	La ils echangerent de nouveau ces sentiments et ces promesses qui avaient deja une fois engage leur avenir et qui avaient ete suivis de longues annees de separation et d'indifference.	0.284516
There they returned again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.	Ils se rappelerent le passe, plus parfaitement heureux qu'ils ne l'avaient jamais ete, plus tendres, plus eprouves, plus certains de la fidelite et de l'attachement l'un de l'autre ; plus disposes a agir, et plus justifies en le faisant.	0.324
And there, as they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.		-0.3
All the little variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end.	Ils montaient lentement la pente douce, ne voyant rien autour d'eux, ni les passants qui les coudoyaient.	0.266667
She had not mistaken him. ~~~ Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.	Ils s'expliquaient et se racontaient, sans se lasser jamais, les journees precedentes.	-0.0236842
That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last four-and-twenty hours.		-0.3
It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.		-0.3
Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified. ~~~ He persisted in having loved none but her.	C'etait bien la jalousie qui avait dirige toute la conduite de Wenvorth ; mais il n'avait jamais aime qu'elle.	-0.00483871
She had never been supplanted.		-0.3
He never even believed himself to see her equal.	Il avait voulu l'oublier, et croyait y avoir reussi.	0.270732
Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge: that he had been constant unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it to be done.		-0.3
He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been a sufferer from them.	Il s'etait cru indifferent, tandis qu'il n'etait qu'irrite ; il avait ete injuste pour les qualites d'Anna, parce qu'il en avait souffert.	0.42535
Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself. ~~~ At Lyme, he had received lessons of more than one sort.	Maintenant elle etait pour lui la perfection absolue, mais il reconnaissait qu'a Uppercross seulement il avait appris a lui rendre justice, et qu'a Lyme seulement il avait commence a se connaitre lui-meme.	0.140675
The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority.	L'admiration de M. Elliot pour Anna avait reveille son affection, et les incidents du Cobb et la suite avaient etabli la superiorite d'Anna.	0.544872
In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.	Il avait fait des efforts inutiles pour s'attacher a Louisa, sans se douter qu'une autre femme avait deja pris possession de son coeur.	-0.243421
There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.	Il avait appris alors a distinguer la fermete de principes, de l'entetement et de l'amour-propre ; un esprit resolu et equilibre, d'un esprit temeraire.	0.366923
There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.	Tout contribuait a elever dans son estime la femme qu'il avait perdue ; et il commencait a deplorer l'orgueil et la folie qui l'avaient empeche de la regagner quand elle etait sur sa route.	0.250318
From that period his penance had become severe.	Des lors sa punition avait commence.	0.215625
He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.	A peine delivre du remords et de l'horreur causes par l'accident de Lyme, il s'etait apercu qu'il n'etait plus libre.	0.0606061
"I found," said he, "that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!	<< Je decouvris, dit-il, que Harville me considerait comme engage avec Louisa.	0.485007
That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment.	L'honneur me commandait de l'epouser, puisque j'avais ete imprudent.	0.260656
I was startled and shocked. ~~~ To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal. ~~~ I was hers in honour if she wished it. ~~~ I had been unguarded.	Je n'avais pas le droit d'essayer si je pourrais m'attacher a une de ces jeunes filles, au risque de faire naitre des bruits facheux.	-0.151081
I had not thought seriously on this subject before.	J'avais peche, j'en devais subir les consequences.	0.293182
I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects. ~~~ I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences."		-0.3
He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.		-0.3
It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.	Je me decidai a quitter Lyme, j'aurais voulu affaiblir par tous les moyens possibles les sentiments que j'avais pu inspirer.	0.341538
He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore, to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.		-0.3
"I was six weeks with Edward," said he, "and saw him happy.	J'allai chez mon frere, il me parla de vous, il me demanda si vous etiez changee.	0.189796
I could have no other pleasure. ~~~ I deserved none.	Il ne soupconnait guere qu'a mes yeux vous ne pouviez jamais changer.	-0.055814
He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."	>> Anna sourit, car il est bien doux a vingt-huit ans de s'entendre dire qu'on n'a perdu aucun des charmes de la jeunesse.	0.246535
Anne smiled, and let it pass. ~~~ It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach.	Elle comparait cet hommage avec d'autres paroles qu'il avait dites, et le savourait delicieusement.	-0.0539063
It is something for a woman to be assured, in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.		-0.3
He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick.		-0.3
"Here," said he, "ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something.	Il en etait la, deplorant son aveuglement et son orgueil, quand l'etonnante et heureuse nouvelle du mariage de Louisa lui rendit sa liberte.	0.289916
But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.		-0.3
Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was. ~~~ Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? ~~~ and to arrive with some degree of hope?	<< Ce fut la fin de mes plus grands tourments, car des lors la route du bonheur m'etait ouverte ; mais attendre dans l'inaction eut ete trop terrible.	-0.108772
You were single.	J'allai a Bath.	0.278571
It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.		-0.3
I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was this for me?'"		-0.3
Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the concert still more.		-0.3
That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments.	Me pardonnez-vous d'y etre arrive avec un peu d'espoir ?	0.293617
The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him: the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy. ~~~ "To see you," cried he, "in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!	Je savais que vous aviez refuse un homme plus riche que moi ; mais vous voir entouree de personnes malveillantes a mon egard ; voir votre cousin causant et souriant, et savoir que tous ceux qui avaient quelque influence sur vous desiraient ce mariage, quand meme vous auriez de l'indifference ou de la repulsion, n'etait-ce pas assez pour me rendre fou ?	-0.0418367
To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you!	-- Il fallait ne pas me soupconner, dit Anna, le cas etait si different.	0.26
Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his!	Si j'ai eu tort en cedant autrefois a la persuasion, souvenez-vous qu'elle etait exercee pour mon bien, je cedais au devoir.	0.25
Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared? ~~~ How could I look on without agony?	Mais ici on ne pouvait invoquer aucun devoir pour me faire epouser un homme qui m'etait indifferent.	0.0915584
Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--was it not all against me?"		-0.3
"You should have distinguished," replied Anne.	-- Je ne pouvais pas raisonner ainsi.	0.20625
"You should not have suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.	J'etais la proie de ces vieux sentiments dont j'avais tant souffert.	0.213559
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.	Je me souvenais seulement que vous m'aviez abandonne croyant aux autres plutot qu'a moi, et qu'enfin vous etiez encore avec la meme personne qui vous avait guidee, dans cette annee de malheur.	0.128155
When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.	-- J'aurais cru, dit Anna, que ma maniere d'etre pouvait vous epargner tout ce chagrin ?	0.263636
In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated." ~~~ "Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus," he replied, "but I could not.	-- Non ; vous aviez l'air aise d'une personne qui est engagee ailleurs, et cependant j'etais decide a vous revoir.	0.0533333
I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character.	>> Anna rentra chez elle, plus heureuse que personne ici n'aurait pu comprendre.	0.291304
I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year. ~~~ I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.	Tous les sentiments penibles du matin etaient dissipes : son bonheur etait si grand, que, pour contenir sa joie, elle fut obligee de se dire qu'elle ne pouvait pas durer.	-0.0336207
I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery. ~~~ I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.	Elle alla s'enfermer dans sa chambre, pour pouvoir en jouir ensuite avec plus de calme.	-0.0381356
The force of habit was to be added."	Le soir vint, les salons se remplirent.	0.26
"I should have thought," said Anne, "that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this."		-0.3
"No, no! ~~~ your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give.	C'etait une soiree banale, trop nombreuse pour etre intime, pas assez pour etre animee.	-0.008
I left you in this belief; and yet, I was determined to see you again.		-0.3
My spirits rallied with the morning, and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here."	Cependant jamais soiree ne parut plus courte a Anna.	0.38
At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house could have conceived.	Jolie et rougissante d'emotion et de bonheur, elle fut generalement admiree.	0.259701
All the surprise and suspense, and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.	Elle ne trouvait la que des indifferents ou des gens sympathiques, les premiers elle les laissait de cote ; elle causait gaiment avec les autres, puis elle echangeait quelques mots avec Wenvorth, et elle sentait qu'il etait la !	0.284293
An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment.	Ce fut dans un de ces courts moments qu'elle lui dit : << J'ai tache de me juger impartialement, et je crois que j'ai fait mon devoir en me laissant influencer par l'amie qui me servait de mere.	0.239241
The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.	Je ne veux pas dire pourtant qu'elle ne se trompait pas : l'avenir lui a donne tort.	0.286364
It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found an evening shorter.	Quant a moi, je ne voudrais jamais dans une circonstance semblable imposer mon avis.	0.0208333
Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.	Mais si j'avais desobei, j'aurais ete tourmentee par ma conscience ; aujourd'hui je n'ai rien a me reprocher, et je crois que le sentiment du devoir n'est pas le plus mauvais lot d'une femme en ce monde.	0.276923
Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him. ~~~ The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.	>> Il regarda Anna, puis lady Russel : << Je ne lui pardonne pas encore ; mais j'espere plus tard etre bien avec elle.	-0.0015625
Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.	-- Je me suis demande aussi si je n'avais pas ete moi-meme mon plus grand ennemi.	0.295522
She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister.	Dites-moi, si je vous avais ecrit, quand je fus nomme commandant de la Laconia, m'auriez-vous repondu ?	0.289412
With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.		-0.3
It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said-- "I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now.		-0.3
To me, she was in the place of a parent.	M'auriez-vous promis votre main ?	0.28
Do not mistake me, however.	-- Oui, je l'aurais fait !	0.272727
I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.		-0.3
It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.		-0.3
But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience.		-0.3
I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion."		-0.3
He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her, replied, as if in cool deliberation-- "Not yet.		-0.3
But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.	>> fut toute sa reponse ; mais le ton etait decisif.	0.292857
I trust to being in charity with her soon.		-0.3
But I too have been thinking over the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady?		-0.3
My own self.	-- Mon Dieu !	0.3
Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter?		-0.3
Would you, in short, have renewed the engagement then?" ~~~ "Would I!"		-0.3
was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.		-0.3
"Good God!" ~~~ he cried, "you would!	s'ecria-t-il ; est-ce vrai ?	-0.036
It is not that I did not think of it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I was proud, too proud to ask again. ~~~ I did not understand you.	j'y pensais et je le souhaitais, comme le couronnement de tous mes succes, mais j'etais trop orgueilleux pour vous demander une seconde fois.	-0.0121622
I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice. ~~~ This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself.	Si j'avais voulu vous comprendre et vous rendre justice, six annees de reparation et de souffrance m'eussent ete epargnees !	-0.0254717
Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.	Ce m'est une douleur d'un nouveau genre.	0.145714
It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.	Je me suis accoutume a croire que je meritais tout ce qui m'arrivait d'heureux.	0.272436
I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed. ~~~ I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.	Comme d'autres grands hommes dans les revers, ajouta-t-il avec un sourire, je dois m'efforcer de soumettre mon esprit a ma destinee.	-0.0252212
Like other great men under reverses," he added, with a smile.	Je dois apprendre a me trouver heureux plus que je ne merite.	0.544118
"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.		-0.3
I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve."	>> CHAPITRE XXIV Qui peut douter de la suite de l'histoire ?	0.259091
Chapter 24 Who can be in doubt of what followed? ~~~ When any two young people take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.	Quand deux jeunes gens se mettent en tete de se marier, ils sont surs, par la perseverance, d'arriver a leur but, quelque pauvres, quelque imprudents qu'ils soient.	-0.0615108
This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing down every opposition?	C'est la peut-etre une dangereuse morale, mais je crois que c'est la vraie, et si ceux-la reussissent, comment un capitaine Wenvorth et une Anna Elliot, ayant toute la maturite de l'esprit, la conscience du droit et une fortune independante, n'auraient-ils pas renverse tous les obstacles ?	0.425221
They might in fact, have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.	Ils n'en rencontrerent pas beaucoup, en realite, car ils n'eurent d'autre opposition que le manque de gracieusete et d'affection.	0.257143
Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned.	Sir Walter ne fit aucune objection, et Elisabeth se contenta de paraitre froide et indifferente.	0.85125
Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him, was no longer nobody.	Le capitaine Wenvorth, avec son merite personnel et ses 25,000 livres, n'etait plus un zero.	0.121519
He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.	On le trouvait digne de rechercher la fille d'un baronnet depensier et absurde, qui n'avait pas eu assez de bon sens pour se maintenir dans la situation ou la Providence l'avait place, et qui ne pouvait donner a sa fille qu'une petite portion des 10 000 livres venant de sa mere.	0.414381
Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.	Sir Walter, malgre sa vanite, etait loin de penser que ce fut la un mauvais mariage.	0.340084
On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.	Au contraire, quand il vit Wenvorth davantage a la lumiere du jour (et il le regarda bien), il fut frappe de sa bonne mine, et il sentit que cette superiorite physique pouvait entrer en balance avec le rang de sa fille. ~~~ Tout cela, aide d'un nom bien sonnant, disposa Sir Walter a preparer sa plume avec bonne grace pour inserer le mariage dans le livre d'honneur.	0.00332226
The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.	La seule personne dont l'opposition pouvait causer une serieuse inquietude etait lady Russel.	0.278049
Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do justice to Captain Wentworth.	Anna savait que cette dame aurait quelque peine a renoncer a M. Elliot et qu'elle devrait faire des efforts pour rendre justice a Wenvorth.	0.284103
This however was what Lady Russell had now to do. ~~~ She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind.	Il lui fallait reconnaitre qu'elle s'etait trompee doublement ; que, les manieres de Wenvorth ne convenant pas a ses idees, elle avait ete trop prompte a lui attribuer un caractere d'une impetuosite dangereuse ; que, les manieres de M. Elliot lui ayant plu precisement par leur correction et leur elegance, leur politesse et leur amenite, elle avait ete trop prompte a y reconnaitre un esprit bien equilibre.	-0.0295447
There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes.	Elle avait a faire une nouvelle provision d'opinions et d'esperances. ~~~ Il y a chez quelques personnes une penetration naturelle que l'experience ne peut egaler.	0.0832
There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend.	Lady Russel avait ete moins douee que sa jeune amie ; mais c'etait une excellente femme, et si elle avait la pretention d'avoir un bon jugement, elle voulait, avant tout, le bonheur d'Anna.	0.2914
But she was a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.	Quand la gene du premier moment fut passee, elle se mit a aimer comme une mere l'homme qui assurait le bonheur de son enfant.	0.417059
She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.		-0.3
Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance.	De toute la famille, Marie fut probablement la plus satisfaite.	0.169091
It was creditable to have a sister married, and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters, it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.	Ce mariage augmentait sa consideration, et elle pouvait se flatter d'y avoir contribue en gardant Anna avec elle pendant l'automne. ~~~ Elle etait fort contente que Wenvorth fut plus riche que Benwick ou Hayter, car sa propre soeur devait etre au-dessus des soeurs de son mari.	0.0195458
She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.	Elle eut a souffrir, peut-etre, de voir reprendre a Anna son droit d'ainesse dans la societe, et de la voir proprietaire d'un joli landau ; mais elle avait un avenir qu'Anna n'avait pas.	0.393245
Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.	Son mari etait fils aine, et il heriterait d'Uppercross ; et si elle pouvait empecher Wenvorth d'etre fait baronnet, elle ne voudrait pas changer avec Anna.	0.227273
It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.	Il est a desirer que la soeur ainee soit egalement satisfaite de son sort, car un changement n'est pas probable.	0.401368
She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.	Elle a eu la mortification de voir M. Elliot se retirer, et personne ne s'est presente qui puisse faire naitre en elle le moindre espoir.	0.446559
The news of his cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly.	La nouvelle du mariage d'Anna fut pour M. Elliot un evenement inattendu.	0.506576
It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law's rights would have given.	Il derangeait ses plans de bonheur conjugal et son espoir de garder Sir Walter celibataire, en le surveillant de pres.	0.486714
But, though discomfited and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment.	Quoique deroute et desappointe, il pouvait encore faire quelque chose pour son propre plaisir et son interet.	0.290426
He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman, at least.	Il quitta Bath, et Mme Clay, s'en allant bientot apres, le bruit courut qu'elle s'etait etablie a Londres sous sa protection.	0.0740995
Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter.	On vit alors qu'il avait joue double jeu et qu'il etait resolu a empecher cette femme artificieuse de l'evincer.	0.189474
She has abilities, however, as well as affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William.	Chez Mme Clay, la passion l'avait emporte sur l'interet, elle etait rusee cependant aussi bien que passionnee ; et l'on se demande aujourd'hui qui des deux sera le plus habile : si M. Elliot, apres l'avoir empechee d'epouser Sir Walter, ne sera pas amene a en faire sa femme.	0.468158
It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their deception in her.	Sir Walter et Elisabeth furent sans nul doute froisses et vexes en decouvrant la duplicite de Mme Clay.	0.470962
They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of half enjoyment.	Ils ont, il est vrai, pour se consoler leur grande cousine, mais ils sentiront bientot que le metier de courtisan n'est pas toujours agreable. ~~~ Anna n'eut qu'un nuage a son bonheur ; ce fut de voir que personne dans sa famille n'etait digne de Wenvorth.	-0.0361765
Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.	La disproportion de fortune ne lui donna pas un moment de regret ; mais ne pouvoir offrir a son mari l'accueil bienveillant d'une famille respectable, en echange de l'accueil empresse de ses beaux-freres et belles-soeurs, fut pour elle une source de chagrin.	0.362887
There she felt her own inferiority very keenly. ~~~ The disproportion in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.	Elle n'avait dans le monde que deux amies a ajouter a ceux de son mari : lady Russel et Mme Shmith ; il etait tout dispose a aimer la premiere, et, pourvu qu'on ne l'obligeat pas a dire qu'elle avait eu raison de les separer, il voulait bien lui reconnaitre toutes les autres qualites.	-0.0207764
She had but two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs Smith.	Quant a Mme Shmith, elle avait des titres pour etre aimee tout de suite : les bons offices qu'elle avait rendus a Anna.	0.167647
To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself.	Elle acquit deux amis au lieu d'une, et fut la premiere a les visiter.	0.277778
Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now value from his heart.	Le capitaine s'acquitta envers elle en lui faisant recouvrer sa propriete des Indes.	0.283562
While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently.		-0.3
Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her two.		-0.3
She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband's property in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully requited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.	Cette augmentation de revenu, jointe a une amelioration de sante et a la frequentation d'aussi bons amis, entretint sa gaite et sa vivacite, et elle defia alors les plus grandes richesses d'ajouter a son contentement ; mais la source de son bonheur etait en elle et dans son caractere, comme celui d'Anna etait dans son coeur aimant.	0.32683
Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income, with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.		-0.3
She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be happy.	Anna etait tout tendresse, et Wenvorth l'aima autant qu'elle en etait digne.	0.295385
Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her friend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.		-0.3
Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's affection.	La crainte de la guerre fut la seule ombre a son bonheur.	0.0893617
His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine.		-0.3
She gloried in being a sailor's wife, but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance.	Elle se glorifiait d'etre la femme d'un marin, mais il fallait payer cette gloire par les alarmes dues a cette profession, ou les vertus domestiques brillent peut-etre d'un plus vif eclat que les vertus patriotiques.	0.369619
