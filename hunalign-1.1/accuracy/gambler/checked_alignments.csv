The Gambler by Fyodor Dostoyevsky Translated by C. J. Hogarth I At length I returned from two weeks leave of absence to find that my patrons had arrived three days ago in Roulettenberg.,I Je suis enfin revenu de mon absence de deux semaines.,0,not aligned
I received from them a welcome quite different to that which I had expected.,Les notres etaient depuis trois jours a Roulettenbourg.,1,not aligned
,"Je pensais qu'ils m'attendaient avec Dieu sait quelle impatience, mais je me trompais.",2,not aligned
"The General eyed me coldly, greeted me in rather haughty fashion, and dismissed me to pay my respects to his sister.","Le general me regarda d'un air tres independant, me parla avec hauteur et me renvoya a sa soeur.",3,aligned
It was clear that from _somewhere_ money had been acquired.,Il etait clair qu'ils avaient gagne quelque part de l'argent.,4,aligned
I thought I could even detect a certain shamefacedness in the General s glance.,Il me semblait meme que le general avait un peu honte de me regarder.,5,aligned
"Maria Philipovna, too, seemed distraught, and conversed with me with an air of detachment.",Maria Felipovna etait tres affairee et me parla a la hate.,6,not aligned
"Nevertheless, she took the money which I handed to her, counted it, and listened to what I had to tell.","Elle prit pourtant l'argent, le compta et ecouta tout mon rapport. ~~~ On attendait pour le diner Mezentsov, le petit Francais et un Anglais.",7,aligned
"To luncheon there were expected that day a Monsieur Mezentsov, a French lady, and an Englishman; for, whenever money was in hand, a banquet in Muscovite style was always given.","Comme ils ne manquaient pas de le faire quand ils avaient de l'argent, en vrais Moscovites qu'ils sont, mes maitres avaient organise un diner d'apparat.",8,not aligned
"Polina Alexandrovna, on seeing me, inquired why I had been so long away.","En me voyant, Paulina Alexandrovna me demanda pourquoi j'etais reste si longtemps, et disparut sans attendre ma reponse.",9,not aligned
"Then, without waiting for an answer, she departed.",Evidemment elle agissait ainsi a dessein.,10,not aligned
"Evidently this was not mere accident, and I felt that I must throw some light upon matters.",Il faut pourtant nous expliquer ; j'ai beaucoup de choses a lui dire.,11,not aligned
It was high time that I did so.,On m'assigna une petite chambre au quatrieme etage de l'hotel.,12,not aligned
I was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you must know that I belonged to the General s suite).,-- On sait ici que j'appartiens a la suite du general.,13,not aligned
"So far as I could see, the party had already gained some notoriety in the place, which had come to look upon the General as a Russian nobleman of great wealth.","-- Le general passe pour un tres riche seigneur. ~~~ Avant le diner, il me donna entre autres commissions celle de changer des billets de mille francs.",14,not aligned
"Indeed, even before luncheon he charged me, among other things, to get two thousand-franc notes changed for him at the hotel counter, which put us in a position to be thought millionaires at all events for a week!","J'ai fait de la monnaie dans le bureau de l'hotel ; nous voila, aux yeux des gens, millionnaires au moins durant toute une semaine.",15,aligned
"Later, I was about to take Mischa and Nadia for a walk when a summons reached me from the staircase that I must attend the General.",Je voulus d'abord prendre Nicha et Nadia pour me promener avec eux.,16,not aligned
"He began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going to take the children; and as he did so, I could see that he failed to look me in the eyes.",Mais de l'escalier on m'appela chez le general : il desirait savoir ou je les menais.,17,not aligned
"He _wanted_ to do so, but each time was met by me with such a fixed, disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion.","Decidement, cet homme ne peut me regarder en face.",18,not aligned
"In pompous language, however, which jumbled one sentence into another, and at length grew disconnected, he gave me to understand that I was to lead the children altogether away from the Casino, and out into the park.",,19,not aligned
"Finally his anger exploded, and he added sharply: ""I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette?","Il s'y efforce ; mais chaque fois je lui reponds par un regard si fixe, si calme qu'il perd aussitot contenance.",20,not aligned
"Well, excuse my speaking so plainly, but I know how addicted you are to gambling.","En un discours tres pompeux, par phrases etagees solennellement, il m'expliqua que je devais me promener avec les enfants dans le parc.",21,not aligned
"Though I am not your mentor, nor wish to be, at least I have a right to require that you shall not actually _compromise_ me.""","Enfin, il se facha tout a coup, et ajouta avec roideur : -- Car vous pourriez bien, si je vous laissais faire, les mener a la gare, a la roulette.",22,not aligned
"""I have no money for gambling,"" I quietly replied.","Vous en etes bien capable, vous avez la tete legere.",23,not aligned
"""But you will soon be in receipt of some,"" retorted the General, reddening a little as he dived into his writing desk and applied himself to a memorandum book. ~~~ From it he saw that he had 120 roubles of mine in his keeping.","Quoique je ne sois pas votre mentor, -- et c'est un role que je n'ambitionne point, -- j'ai le droit de desirer que... en un mot... que vous ne me compromettiez pas... -- Mais pour perdre de l'argent il faut en avoir, repondis-je tranquillement, et je n'en ai point.",24,not aligned
"""Let us calculate,"" he went on.","-- Vous allez en avoir, dit-il un peu confus.",25,not aligned

"When returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a cavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins.","Si je vous ai fait cette observation, c'est... pour ainsi dire... pour vous prevenir, et j'en ai bien le droit...",33,not aligned
"Two splendid carriages, magnificently horsed, with Mlle.","En rentrant, avant le diner, je rencontrai toute une cavalcade.",34,not aligned
"Blanche, Maria Philipovna, and Polina Alexandrovna in one of them, and the Frenchman, the Englishman, and the General in attendance on horseback!","Les notres allaient visiter quelques ruines celebres dans les environs : Mlle Blanche dans une belle voiture avec Maria Felipovna et Paulina ; le petit Francais, l'Anglais et notre general a cheval.",35,aligned
"The passers-by stopped to stare at them, for the effect was splendid the General could not have improved upon it.","Les passants s'arretaient et regardaient : l'effet etait obtenu. ~~~ Seulement, le general n'a qu'a se bien tenir.",36,not aligned
"I calculated that, with the 4000 francs which I had brought with me, added to what my patrons seemed already to have acquired, the party must be in possession of at least 7000 or 8000 francs though that would be none too much for Mlle.","J'ai calcule que, des cinquante-quatre mille francs que j'ai apportes, -- en y ajoutant meme ce qu'il a pu se procurer ici, -- il ne doit plus avoir que sept ou huit mille francs ; c'est tres peu pour Mlle Blanche.",37,not aligned
"Blanche, who, with her mother and the Frenchman, was also lodging in our hotel.","Elle habite aussi dans notre hotel, avec sa mere.",38,not aligned
"The latter gentleman was called by the lacqueys ""Monsieur le Comte,"" and Mlle.","Quelque part encore, dans la meme maison, loge le petit Francais, que les domestiques appellent << Monsieur le comte >>.",39,not aligned
"Blanche s mother was dubbed ""Madame la Comtesse.""",La mere de Mlle Blanche est une << Madame la comtesse >>.,40,not aligned
"Perhaps in very truth they _were_ ""Comte et Comtesse.""",Et pourquoi ne seraient-ils pas comte et comtesse ?,41,not aligned
"I knew that ""Monsieur le Comte"" would take no notice of me when we met at dinner, as also that the General would not dream of introducing us, nor of recommending me to the ""Comte.""","A table, M. le comte ne me reconnut pas. ~~~ Certes, le general ne songeait pas a nous presenter l'un a l'autre ; et quant a M. le comte, il a vecu en Russie et sait bien qu'un outchitel[1] n'est pas un oiseau de haut vol.",42,not aligned
"However, the latter had lived awhile in Russia, and knew that the person referred to as an ""uchitel"" is never looked upon as a bird of fine feather.",-- Il va sans dire qu'il m'a reellement tres bien reconnu. ~~~ -- Je crois d'ailleurs qu'on ne s'attendait meme pas a me voir au diner.,43,not aligned
"Of course, strictly speaking, he _knew_ me; but I was an uninvited guest at the luncheon the General had forgotten to arrange otherwise, or I should have been dispatched to dine at the table d h te.","Le general a sans doute oublie de donner des ordres a cet effet, mais son intention etait certainement de m'envoyer diner a la table d'hote.",44,not aligned
"Nevertheless, I presented myself in such guise that the General looked at me with a touch of approval; and, though the good Maria Philipovna was for showing me my place, the fact of my having previously met the Englishman, Mr. Astley, saved me, and thenceforward I figured as one of the company.",Je compris cela au regard mecontent dont il m'honora. ~~~ La bonne Maria Felipovna m'indiqua aussitot ma place.,45,not aligned
"This strange Englishman I had met first in Prussia, where we had happened to sit _vis- -vis_ in a railway train in which I was travelling to overtake our party; while, later, I had run across him in France, and again in Switzerland twice within the space of two weeks!","Mais M. Astley m'aida a sortir de cette situation desagreable, et, malgre le general, M. le comte et Mme la comtesse, je parvins a etre de leur societe.",46,not aligned
"To think, therefore, that I should suddenly encounter him again here, in Roulettenberg!","J'avais fait la connaissance de cet Anglais en Prusse, dans un wagon ou nous etions assis l'un pres de l'autre.",47,not aligned
,Je l'avais revu depuis en France et en Suisse.,48,not aligned
"Never in my life had I known a more retiring man, for he was shy to the pitch of imbecility, yet well aware of the fact (for he was no fool).","Je ne vis jamais d'homme aussi timide ; timide jusqu'a la betise, mais seulement apparente, car il s'en faut de beaucoup qu'il soit sot.",49,aligned
"At the same time, he was a gentle, amiable sort of an individual, and, even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived to draw him out, and he had told me that he had just been to the North Cape, and was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod.",Il est d'un commerce doux et agreable. ~~~ Il etait alle durant l'ete au cap Nord et desirait assister a la foire de Nijni-Novgorod.,50,aligned
"How he had come to make the General s acquaintance I do not know, but, apparently, he was much struck with Polina.",Je ne sais comment il a fait la connaissance du general.,51,not aligned
"Also, he was delighted that I should sit next him at table, for he appeared to look upon me as his bosom friend.",Il me semble eperdument amoureux de Paulina.,52,not aligned
During the meal the Frenchman was in great feather: he was discursive and pompous to every one.,Il etait tres content que je fusse a table aupres de lui et me traitait comme son meilleur ami.,53,not aligned
"In Moscow too, I remembered, he had blown a great many bubbles.",Le petit Francais dirigeait la conversation.,54,not aligned
"Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian politics, and though, at times, the General made feints to contradict him, he did so humbly, and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight of his own dignity.","Hautain avec tout le monde, il parlait finances et politique russes et ne se laissait contredire que par le general, qui le faisait d'ailleurs avec une sorte de deference.",55,aligned
"For myself, I was in a curious frame of mind.",J'etais dans une tres etrange disposition d'esprit.,56,aligned
"Even before luncheon was half finished I had asked myself the old, eternal question: ""_Why_ do I continue to dance attendance upon the General, instead of having left him and his family long ago?""","Des avant le milieu du diner, je me posai ma question ordinaire : << Pourquoi me trainer encore a la suite de ce general et ne l'avoir pas depuis longtemps quitte ?",57,aligned
"Every now and then I would glance at Polina Alexandrovna, but she paid me no attention; until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to play the boor.",>> Je regardai Paulina Alexandrovna ; mais elle ne faisait pas la moindre attention a moi. ~~~ Je finis par me facher et me decidai a etre grossier.,58,aligned
"First of all I suddenly, and for no reason whatever, plunged loudly and gratuitously into the general conversation.",De but en blanc je me melai a la conversation ; j'avais la demangeaison de chercher querelle au petit Francais.,59,not aligned
"Above everything I wanted to pick a quarrel with the Frenchman; and, with that end in view I turned to the General, and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of way indeed, I think that I actually interrupted him that that summer it had been almost impossible for a Russian to dine anywhere at tables d h te.","Je m'adressai au general et, tout a coup, lui coupant la parole, je lui fis observer que les Russes ne savent pas diner a une table d'hote.",60,not aligned
The General bent upon me a glance of astonishment.,Le general me regarda avec etonnement.,61,aligned
"""If one is a man of self-respect,"" I went on, ""one risks abuse by so doing, and is forced to put up with insults of every kind.","-- Par exemple, dis-je, un homme considerable ne manque pas dans ces occasions de s'attirer une affaire.",62,not aligned
"Both at Paris and on the Rhine, and even in Switzerland there are so many Poles, with their sympathisers, the French, at these tables d h te that one cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian.""","A Paris, sur le Rhin, en Suisse, les tables d'hote sont pleines de petits Polonais et de petits Francais qui ne cessent de parler et ne tolerent pas qu'un Russe place un seul mot.",63,aligned
This I said in French.,Je dis cela en francais.,64,not aligned
"The General eyed me doubtfully, for he did not know whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so far forget myself.","Le general me regardait toujours avec etonnement, ne sachant s'il devait se facher.",65,not aligned
"""Of course, one always learns _something everywhere_,"" said the Frenchman in a careless, contemptuous sort of tone.","-- Cela signifie qu'on vous aura donne une lecon quelque part, dit le petit Francais avec un nonchalant mepris.",66,not aligned
"""In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole,"" I continued, ""and then with a French officer who supported him. ~~~ After that a section of the Frenchmen present took my part. ~~~ They did so as soon as I told them the story of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor s coffee.""","-- A Paris, je me suis querelle avec un Polonais, repondis-je, puis avec un officier francais qui soutenait le Polonais ; une partie des Francais passa de mon cote quand je leur racontai que j'avais voulu cracher dans le cafe d'un << Monseigneur >>.",67,aligned
"""To spit into it?""",-- Cracher !,68,not aligned

"""Just so,"" I replied.","-- Precisement, repondis-je.",70,aligned
"""You must know that, on one occasion, when, for two days, I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on business, I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris, to have my passport visaed.","Comme j'etais convaincu que, deux jours apres, je serais oblige d'aller a Rome pour nos affaires, je m'etais rendu a l'ambassade du Saint-Pere pour faire viser mon passeport.",71,aligned
"There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty, and a man dry and cold of mien.","La, je rencontrai un petit abbe d'une cinquantaine d'annees, sec, a la figure compassee.",72,not aligned
"After listening politely, but with great reserve, to my account of myself, this sacristan asked me to wait a little.","Il m'ecouta avec politesse, mais me pria tres sechement d'attendre.",73,aligned
"I was in a great hurry to depart, but of course I sat down, pulled out a copy of _L Opinion Nationale_, and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to contain.",,74,not aligned
"As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for Monsignor; after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took his leave.",J'etais presse ; je m'assis pourtant et me mis a lire l'Opinion nationale.,75,not aligned
"I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also; whereupon, with an expression of, if anything, increased dryness, he again asked me to wait.",Je tombai sur une terrible attaque contre la Russie. ~~~ Pourtant j'entendis de la chambre voisine quelqu'un entrer chez le Monsignore.,76,not aligned
"Soon a third visitor arrived who, like myself, had come on business (he was an Austrian of some sort); and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs!",J'avise mon abbe et je lui demande si ce ne sera pas bientot mon tour.,77,not aligned
This made me very angry.,Encore plus sechement il me prie d'attendre.,78,not aligned

"I rose, approached the sacristan, and told him that, since Monsignor was receiving callers, his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well.","Alors je me mets en colere, je me leve, et, m'approchant de l'abbe, je lui dis avec fermete : << Puisque Monseigneur recoit, introduisez-moi !",80,not aligned

It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor s!,"Qu'un simple Russe pretendit etre traite comme les autres, cela depassait la jugeote du frocard.",82,not aligned
"In a tone of the utmost effrontery, as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me, he looked me up and down, and then said: ""Do you suppose that Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for _you?_"" But I only cried the louder: ""Let me tell you that I am going to _spit_ into that coffee!","Il me regarda des pieds a la tete et me dit d'un ton provocant, comme s'il se rejouissait de m'offenser : << C'est cela ! ~~~ Monseigneur va laisser refroidir son cafe pour vous !",83,not aligned

"In a word, I showed him that I was not going to give way. ~~~ He looked at me with an air of infinite resentment.","L'abbe me regarda avec le plus singulier des sourires, un sourire qui exprimait une rancune et une colere infinies, puis arracha de mes mains le passeport.",89,not aligned

"A fat Polish nobleman, who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d h te, at once went upstairs, while some of the Frenchmen were simply disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man at whom, in 1812, a French hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket.","Les Francais memes ne m'interrompirent pas quand je racontai que deux ans auparavant, en 1812, j'avais vu un homme contre lequel un soldat francais avait tire, uniquement pour decharger son fusil.",99,not aligned

"As a beginning she dismissed her Pole of the previous day the Pole whose hair she had pulled and took to herself another one; but the latter proved worse even than the former, and incurred dismissal in favour of the first Pole, who, during the time of his unemployment, had nevertheless hovered around the Grandmother s chair, and from time to time obtruded his head over her shoulder.",,2533,not aligned
"At length the old lady became desperate, for the second Pole, when dismissed, imitated his predecessor by declining to go away; with the result that one Pole remained standing on the right of the victim, and the other on her left; from which vantage points the pair quarrelled, abused each other concerning the stakes and rounds, and exchanged the epithet ""laidak""[4] and other Polish terms of endearment.",,2534,not aligned
"Finally, they effected a mutual reconciliation, and, tossing the money about anyhow, played simply at random.",>> -- La babouschka le mit a la porte en le menacant avec une canne.,2535,not aligned
"Once more quarrelling, each of them staked money on his own side of the Grandmother s chair (for instance, the one Pole staked upon the red, and the other one upon the black), until they had so confused and browbeaten the old lady that, nearly weeping, she was forced to appeal to the head croupier for protection, and to have the two Poles expelled.",,2536,not aligned
"No time was lost in this being done, despite the rascals cries and protestations that the old lady was in their debt, that she had cheated them, and that her general behaviour had been mean and dishonourable.",,2537,not aligned
The same evening the unfortunate Potapitch related the story to me with tears complaining that the two men had filled their pockets with money (he himself had seen them do it) which had been shamelessly pilfered from his mistress.,,2538,not aligned
"For instance, one Pole demanded of the Grandmother fifty g lden for his trouble, and then staked the money by the side of her stake.",,2539,not aligned

"In fact, in, view of the circumstance that she lost all day, the croupiers and other authorities of the Casino showed her every attention; and on her fame spreading through the town, visitors of every nationality even the most knowing of them, the most distinguished crowded to get a glimpse of ""la vieille comtesse russe, tomb e en enfance,"" who had lost ""so many millions.""",,2542,not aligned

"Though polite enough to the old lady, he took a high hand with the bystanders. ~~~ In short, he offered himself less as a servant than as an _entertainer_.","Ils songerent serieusement a employer en effet la police, sous pretexte que la babouschka etait folle, prodigue, etc...",2544,not aligned
"After each round he would turn to the old lady, and swear terrible oaths to the effect that he was a ""Polish gentleman of honour"" who would scorn to take a kopeck of her money; and, though he repeated these oaths so often that at length she grew alarmed, he had her play in hand, and began to win on her behalf; wherefore, she felt that she could not well get rid of him.",,2545,not aligned
"An hour later the two Poles who, earlier in the day, had been expelled from the Casino, made a reappearance behind the old lady s chair, and renewed their offers of service even if it were only to be sent on messages; but from Potapitch I subsequently had it that between these rascals and the said ""gentleman of honour"" there passed a wink, as well as that the latter put something into their hands.",,2546,not aligned
"Next, since the Grandmother had not yet lunched she had scarcely for a moment left her chair one of the two Poles ran to the restaurant of the Casino, and brought her thence a cup of soup, and afterwards some tea.","Mais de Grillet haussait les epaules, se moquait du general, qui allait et venait dans son cabinet, la tete perdue.",2547,not aligned
"In fact, _both_ the Poles hastened to perform this office.","Enfin, le petit Francais fit un geste desespere et s'en alla.",2548,not aligned
"Finally, towards the close of the day, when it was clear that the Grandmother was about to play her last bank-note, there could be seen standing behind her chair no fewer than six natives of Poland persons who, as yet, had been neither audible nor visible; and as soon as ever the old lady played the note in question, they took no further notice of her, but pushed their way past her chair to the table; seized the money, and staked it shouting and disputing the while, and arguing with the ""gentleman of honour"" (who also had forgotten the Grandmother s existence), as though he were their equal.",,2549,not aligned
"Even when the Grandmother had lost her all, and was returning (about eight o clock) to the hotel, some three or four Poles could not bring themselves to leave her, but went on running beside her chair and volubly protesting that the Grandmother had cheated them, and that she ought to be made to surrender what was not her own.",,2550,not aligned

"In fact, she managed it so that he had to follow everywhere in her train whether when promenading on the Boulevards, or when driving, or when going to the theatre, or when paying calls; and this use which she made of him quite satisfied the General.","Il etait presentable, convenable, d'une taille au-dessus de la moyenne, avec des favoris teints et ses grandes moustaches de cuirassier.",3348,not aligned
"Still of imposing appearance and presence, as well as of fair height, he had a dyed moustache and whiskers (he had formerly been in the cuirassiers), and a handsome, though a somewhat wrinkled, face.",D'excellentes manieres d'ailleurs ; il portait tres congrument le frac et exhibait toutes ses decorations.,3349,not aligned
"Also, his manners were excellent, and he could carry a frockcoat well the more so since, in Paris, he took to wearing his orders.","Enfin, un tel cavalier etait tres bon a montrer au boulevard, tres bon et tres recommandable.",3350,not aligned
"To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a thing possible, but also, so to speak, a thing advisable, and with this programme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find.","Ce pauvre homme ne se tenait pas de joie, car il ne comptait guere sur un tel accueil ; il etait dans un perpetuel transport de felicite febrile que je me gardais bien de troubler.",3351,not aligned

"Already I had learnt that, after our unexpected departure from Roulettenberg, he had had a sort of a fit that he had fallen into a swoon, and spent a week in a species of garrulous delirium.","On l'avait condamne a un traitement rigoureux ; mais, un beau jour, il s'echappa : servir de laquais a Blanche etait pour lui le seul traitement efficace.",3354,not aligned

"To think clearly, or even to engage in any serious conversation, had now become impossible for him; he could only ejaculate after each word ""Hm!""",,3357,not aligned
and then nod his head in confirmation.,(On l'eut retrouvee chez Albert.),3358,not aligned
"Sometimes, also, he would laugh, but only in a nervous, hysterical sort of a fashion; while at other times he would sit for hours looking as black as night, with his heavy eyebrows knitted.",,3359,not aligned
"Of much that went on he remained wholly oblivious, for he grew extremely absent-minded, and took to talking to himself.","Il jetait autour de lui d'etranges regards, comme s'il cherchait quelque chose.",3360,not aligned
Only Blanche could awake him to any semblance of life.,,3361,not aligned
"His fits of depression and moodiness in corners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while, or that she had gone out without taking him with her, or that she had omitted to caress him before departing.","Mais, n'apercevant rien, il perdait le souvenir de ce qu'il desirait et tombait en torpeur jusqu'au moment ou Blanche, gaie, vive, vetue a miracle, apparaissait, apres s'etre annoncee par un frais eclat de rire.",3362,not aligned

"Next, after remaining in this condition for an hour or two (this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had gone out for the day probably to see Albert), he would begin to look about him, and to grow uneasy, and to hurry about with an air as though he had suddenly remembered something, and must try and find it; after which, not perceiving the object of his search, nor succeeding in recalling what that object had been, he would as suddenly relapse into oblivion, and continue so until the reappearance of Blanche merry, wanton, half-dressed, and laughing her strident laugh as she approached to pet him, and even to kiss him (though the latter reward he seldom received).",,3364,not aligned
"Once, he was so overjoyed at her doing so that he burst into tears. ~~~ Even I myself was surprised.","Elle plaidait ensuite devant moi la cause du << bon homme >> ; elle etait meme, je vous jure, tres eloquente.",3365,not aligned
"From the first moment of his arrival in Paris, Blanche set herself to plead with me on his behalf; and at such times she even rose to heights of eloquence saying that it was for _me_ she had abandoned him, though she had almost become his betrothed and promised to become so; that it was for _her_ sake he had deserted his family; that, having been in his service, I ought to remember the fact, and to feel ashamed.","Elle me rappelait que c'etait pour moi qu'elle avait quitte le general, qu'elle etait depuis longtemps sa fiancee, qu'elle s'etait engagee a lui par serment, qu'il avait abandonne sa famille pour elle, qu'enfin j'etais son ancien serviteur, que je ne devais pas l'oublier, que je devais avoir honte...",3366,aligned
"To all this I would say nothing, however much she chattered on; until at length I would burst out laughing, and the incident would come to an end (at first, as I have said, she had thought me a fool, but since she had come to deem me a man of sense and sensibility).","Je gardais le silence, je me mettais a rire, et tout finit par la ; c'est-a-dire qu'elle me crut d'abord sot, puis elle s'arreta a la pensee que j'etais bon et d'humeur tres coulante.",3367,aligned
"In short, I had the happiness of calling her better nature into play; for though, at first, I had not deemed her so, she was, in reality, a kind-hearted woman after her own fashion.","En un mot, je sus meriter la bienveillance de cette respectable fille.",3368,not aligned
